      <titre>Django Unchained</titre>
      <synopsis>In 1858, in Texas, the former German dentist Dr. King Schultz meets the slave Django in a lonely road while being transported by the slavers Speck Brothers. He asks if Django knows the Brittle Brothers and with the affirmative, he buys Django for him. Then Dr. Schultz tells that he is a bounty hunter chasing John, Ellis and Roger Brittle and proposes a deal to Django: if he helps him, he would give his freedom, a horse and US$ 75.00 for him. Django accepts the deal and Dr. Schultz trains him to be his deputy. They kill the brothers in Daughtray and Django tells that he would use the money to buy the freedom of his wife Broomhilda, who is a slave that speaks German. Dr. Schultz proposes another deal to Django: if he teams-up with him during the winter, he would give one-third of the rewards and help him to rescue Broomhilda. Django accepts his new deal and they become friends. After the winter, Dr. Schultz goes to Gatlinburgh and learns that Broomhilda was sold to the ruthless Calvin Candie von Shaft, who lives in the Candyland Farm, in Mississippi. Dr. Schultz plots a scheme with Django to lure Calvin and rescue Broomhilda from him. But his cruel minion Stephen is not easily fooled.</synopsis>

            <biographie>Best known for his starring role as Det. Sonny Crockett on the hugely successful TV series _"Miami Vice" (1984)_ (qv), Don Johnson is one of the stars who really defined the 1980s. As James "Sonny" Crockett he went toe-to-toe with drug dealers, pimps, prostitutes, assassins, illegal arms-dealers and crooked cops on a weekly basis from 1984 to 1989, appearing in a grand total of 110 episodes. The show, which was executive-produced by four time Oscar-nominated director, producer and writer 'Michael Mann (I)' (qv), paired Johnson with the equally cool 'Philip Michael Thomas' (qv) as Det. Ricardo Tubbs and the calm and stoic presence of 'Edward James Olmos' (qv) as Lt. Martin Castillo. It revolutionized television with its modern fashion, pop music, unique style and use of real locations. Johnson typically wore $1000 Armani, Versace and Hugo Boss suits over pastel cotton T-shirts, drove a Ferrari 365 GTS/4 Daytona (later a Ferrari Testarossa) and lived on an Endeavour 42-foot sailboat named "St. Vitus' Dance" with his pet alligator Elvis. He also had full use of an offshore powerboat. Still, "Miami Vice" had not only style but substance, and his portrayal of the Vietnam veteran turned vice detective turned Sonny Crockett into the world's favorite cop. For his work on "Miami Vice" Johnson won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series in 1986, and was nominated in the same category a year later. He also picked up an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1985.  Johnson was born in Flat Creek, Missouri, the son of a farmer and a beautician. As a kid he wanted to become a professional bowler. Later, after a few brushes with the law at a young age, he discovered acting. After working on the stage for a while he ventured into films and television, but was not able to break into stardom despite, among other things, starring in the sci-fi cult classic _A Boy and His Dog (1975)_ (qv). During the late 1960s and early 70s, Johnson had two short-lived marriages that were annulled; the names of his first two wives have never been made public. 'Tippi Hedren' (qv), Johnson's co-star in _The Harrad Experiment (1973)_ (qv), allowed him to date her daughter 'Melanie Griffith' (qv) despite the fact that she was only 14 and he was 22; the relationship culminated in a six-month marriage during 1976. In the 1980s he lived with actress 'Patti D'Arbanville' (qv) and they had one son together. He remarried Griffith in 1989, but divorced in 1996 when she left him for 'Antonio Banderas' (qv). Johnson has been married to fifth wife Kelly Phleger since 1999, and they have three children together.  Johnson starred in four failed TV pilots before landing his career-high role on "Miami Vice", which propelled him to superstardom. He directed four highly praised episodes of the show, one of them co-starring Melanie Griffith. He balanced his work on the series by appearing in the critically acclaimed TV film _The Long Hot Summer (1985) (TV)_ (qv), an adaptation of the 'William Faulkner (I)' (qv) novel, and the film _Sweet Hearts Dance (1988)_ (qv) with 'Susan Sarandon' (qv). After the series ended he focused solely on his film career. Although movies like _Dead Bang (1989)_ (qv), _The Hot Spot (1990)_ (qv) and _Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991)_ (qv) did not fare well with the critics, quite a few of them have obtained a considerable cult following, with fans praising them as all being quality contributions to their genre. His film work has given Johnson the opportunity to work with legendary filmmakers like 'John Frankenheimer' (qv), 'Sidney Lumet' (qv) and 'Dennis Hopper' (qv).  After working steadily, Johnson returned to TV in 1996 with the cop show _"Nash Bridges" (1996)_ (qv). The show, which Johnson created and produced, did very well. It co-starred 'Cheech Marin' (qv) and 'Jodi Lyn O'Keefe' (qv). Johnson played the title role, a captain in the San Francisco PD's Special Investigations Unit. He was again paired with a flashy vehicle, this time an electric-yellow 1971 Plymouth Barracuda convertible. After "Nash Bridges" went off the air Johnson kept a low profile, but continues to appear in films and on television. He starred in the failed WB courtroom drama _"Just Legal" (2005)_ (qv), which was produced by 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv), and has traveled to Europe to make such films as the Norwegian screwball comedy _Lange flate ballær II (2008)_ (qv) and the Italian films _Bastardi (2008)_ (qv) and _Torno a vivere da solo (2008)_ (qv). He will soon be seen in the romantic comedy _When in Rome (2010)_ (qv) with 'Anjelica Huston' (qv) and 'Danny DeVito' (qv), as well as the indie comedy _A Good Old Fashioned Orgy (2011)_ (qv). 'Don Johnson (I)' starred in the 2007 feature film, _"Moondance Alexander" (2007)_, along with 'Lori Loughlin' (qv), 'Kay Panabaker' (qv), 'James Best (I)' (qv), 'Sasha Cohen (I)' (qv), and 'Whitney Sloan' (qv).</biographie>

            <biographie>A Manhattan-born character player who attended New York University, actor James Russo wrote and starred in a prize-winning short film, "The Candy Store", while attending college. His first big film break was as a convenience store robber in _Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)_ (qv). Possessed with a stare that can bring shivers down one's back, he has been quite the accessible villain over the years, memorably portraying a number of gritty psychopaths and gangsters, among other undesirables. Surprisingly, Russo is not a name or commodity, yet an intense and dependable "tough guy" performer he has proven to be. One only needs to be reminded of his sadistic sexual animal role in "Extremities" on stage (in which he won a 1983 Theatre World) and in film (in which he terrorized 'Farrah Fawcett' (qv)), to recall how chillingly effective he can be. Other decent roles in films include 'Kevin Costner' (qv)'s _The Postman (1997)_ (qv) and _Open Range (2003)_ (qv), plus _Beverly Hills Cop (1984)_ (qv), _We're No Angels (1989)_ (qv), _Donnie Brasco (1997)_ (qv), _No Way Home (1996)_ (qv), and a number of low-budget crimers. On stage, he has "Welcome to Andromeda", "Deathwatch", "Marat/Sade" and the afore-mentioned "Extremities" to his credit. Russo appeared opposite 'Johnny Depp' (qv) in 'Roman Polanski' (qv)'s _The Ninth Gate (1999)_ (qv), and portrayed mobster "Victor Mura" in TV's short-lived, _"Falcone" (2000)_ (qv), the following year. More recently, he offered a penetrating cameo as 'Frank Sinatra' (qv) in _Stealing Sinatra (2003)_ (qv).</biographie>

            <biographie>Pittsburgh-born actor/SFX wizard/stuntman/director Tom Savini did a tour of duty as a combat cameraman in Vietnam, and has since acquired a remarkable cult following among film fans, primarily due to his ground-breaking SFX in the "splatter movie" explosion of the early 1980s. Along with fellow special make-up legends 'Dick Smith (II)' (qv) and 'Rob Bottin' (qv), Savini was one of the key SFX people behind the startling make-up &amp; EFX seen in the fantasy/horror genre films of the 1980s-'90s. Savini was heavily influenced by the remarkable silent-era actor 'Lon Chaney' (qv), and he sought to emulate the amazing theatrical make-up effects that were a hallmark of Chaney's career. In Savini's insightful book "Grande Illusions", he speaks of his early attempts at applying prosthetics to his face using "spearmint gum", having misinterpreted that he was meant to actually use "spirit gum"!  His first work was in low-budget fare, providing SFX and make-up for independently made horror films such as _Deranged (1974)_ (qv) and _Martin (1976)_ (qv). However, he really caught the attention of horror buffs with his grisly effects in the cult 'George A. Romero (I)' (qv)-directed zombie film _Dawn of the Dead (1978)_ (qv), and then in the controversial slasher film _Friday the 13th (1980)_ (qv), the movie generally identified as the kickstart for the aforementioned "splatter movie" genre. Savini also contributed the incredible EFX &amp; make-up to other splatter thrillers such as _Maniac (1980)_ (qv), _The Burning (1981)_ (qv), _Creepshow (1982)_ (qv) and Romero's third "Dead" film, _Day of the Dead (1985)_ (qv) (for which he won a Saturn Award).  In 1990, Savini directed his feature film debut _Night of the Living Dead (1990)_ (qv), the remake of the original zombie-classic. Not content with just being behind the lens, however, Savini has appeared in dozens of films, and can be seen demonstrating his capable acting skills as "Morgan, the Black Knight" in _Knightriders (1981)_ (qv), as "Blades", one of the biker gang members in _Dawn of the Dead (1978)_ (qv) and as "Sex Machine", another leather-clad biker--but this time with a groin-mounted gun--in the wild vampire film _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv).</biographie>

            <biographie>Christoph Waltz was born to Elisabeth Urbancic, a costume designer, and Johannes Waltz, a stage builder. He has 3 siblings. He was born into a theater family. His grandmother was the Viennese Burgtheater actress Maria Mayen, and his step-grandfather was fellow Burgtheater actor Emmerich Reimers.  Christoph attended the Theresianium and Billrothstrasse in Vienna. Upon graduation, he attended the Max-Reinhardt-Seminar before going to New York to the Lee Strasberg Institute. While in New York, Christoph met his first wife, and moved back to Vienna, then to London.  During the 80s, Christoph worked primarily in theater, commuting from his home in London to Germany. Slowly he began to work in TV, taking one-off roles on series, and TV movies. Film roles soon followed, however, attempts to break into English-speaking film and TV were unsuccessful. Christoph has stated he is grateful to have made a living and supported his family through acting. For thirty years he worked steadily, tirelessly, in this manner.  It was not until he met Quentin Tarantino that his career in Hollywood took off. The role of Colonel Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds catapulted Christoph from a lifetime working in German TV/film to the new life of an international superstar, Academy Award winning actor. He won 27 awards for his performance as Hans Landa, including the Cannes prix d'interpretation Masculin for 2009, the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and the BAFTA Best Supporting Actor award.  Christoph resides in Berlin and Los Angeles. His partner is the costume builder Judith Holste.</biographie>

            <biographie>Dana Gourrier (pronounced Gu-Ree-A) is a native of New Orleans with ancestry dating back 7 generations. Since 8 years old she has been in front of audiences performing: be it singing, dancing, or acting. Her true love of theater began when she was 14 years old at the New Orleans Recreational Department Theater under the program's long-time, late director, Ty Tracy. After receiving her BFA in Performance Art from UL Lafayette, she went to New York in higher pursuits. She continued her studies participating in a five week program studying acting in affiliation with NYU. That summer, Dana saw Shakespeare in the Park's Twelfth Night, which inspired her. At the end of the program and with no place to live, Dana made the bold decision to stay in New York. Eventually she found a tiny studio in Spanish Harlem, waited tables, auditioned, gigged, did background vocals, and even taught theater at a community center in Brooklyn. Dana has performed and also produced original work at: The Red Room Theater, Birdland, Lennox Lounge, Alvin Ailey Citigroup Theater, Under St. Mark's, The Cherry Lane Theater, Summer Stages in Central Park, and La Mama Theater. At La Mama Theater, Dana was apart of a project called Soulagraphie: a series of plays about genocide written by renowned playwright Eric Ehn. She played the title character Maria Kizito: a play about a Rwandan Nun that was tried and convicted of aiding in the death of thousands.  In 2010, Dana completed her MFA in Acting from the reputable California Institute of the Arts, where she was in two world premieres and a long list of other full theatrical productions both Classic and Contemporary. Upon graduating, she came straight home and broke into Hollywood South, as Film and Television were also her great loves. Dana had one goal when deciding to move back home; it was to be on HBO's Treme; the David Simon executively produced show about her hometown. Not only was she on it, but she landed a recurring role.  Since then Dana has worked with some of Hollywood's biggest Academy Award Winners and Nominees. It all began when she landed the role of Cora in Winner Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained. She felt so welcomed and connected to Quentin. She pitched ideas about her character to him, including a song for the funeral scene, which was shot, but would eventually land on the cutting room floor. Her next endeavor was working with Nominee Lee Daniels' on his film, The Butler. She portrayed the role of Helen Holloway, wife of James Holloway, played by Lenny Kravitz.  Additionally, Dana has worked directly with Academy Award Winners and Nominees: Angela Bassett, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Woody Harrelson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jessica Lang, Christoph Waltz, Forest Whitaker, and Oprah Winfrey!  Dana considers herself Tri-Costal, but currently resides in New Orleans, which will always be home.</biographie>

During high school, he played quarterback for his high school team and was good enough that he got press in Dallas newspapers. He studied music in college. He released a music album in 1994, "Peep This" and sings the theme song for his 1999 movie, _Any Given Sunday (1999)_ (qv). However, in 1989, his life changed when a girl friend challenged him to get up onstage at the Comedy Club. In fact, he says he took his androgynous stage name because he learned that women got preference for mike time on open stage nights. That led to his being cast in _"Roc" (1991)_ (qv) and _"In Living Color" (1990)_ (qv) and ultimately to his own WB network TV series. He has a daughter, Corrine, born in 1995, who lives with her mother.</biographie>

            <biographie>J.D. was born in the delta town of Greenville, Mississippi (also the birthplace of Muppets creator Jim Henson) on the same day Richard Nixon was elected president. He is of Irish-French-German-Cherokee-Choctaw decent, the oldest of 7 siblings, and attended 17 different schools (public and private) while moving back and forth between his mother and father. His great-great-great-great uncle was Horace Mann, the founder of the American Public School system. His father (Puddin - yep, that's what they call him) is a welder/artist/amateur archaeologist and inventor. His mother (Sally) has had many professions, including concert promoter and owner of a country/western nightclub called The Headless Horseman, where as a young child, J.D. spent many school nights until the wee hours of the morning hanging out backstage and on stage with the likes of Hank Williams, Jr., Juice Newton, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Paycheck, David Allen Coe, Ray Price, and many others.  After a short stint in college and a 15 month stint in the Marine Corps stationed at 29 Palms, California and after hanging out with some actors in L.A., J.D. thought he would give acting a shot. His only experience with acting had been playing the Prince in his pre-school production of The Nutcracker, and getting kicked out of his senior play, Oklahoma, after his second rehearsal because he and a friend drank a beer before hand. After the Marine Corps, he returned to Mississippi and worked as a debt collector for his mother's collection agency. After a year of hating his job, he decided to return to college and get a degree in theatre at The University of Southern Mississippi. Once on stage at college, he knew acting was what he had to do. His second year in theatre, he was one of 20 finalists in the state selected to attend SETC (Southeastern Theatre Conference). In 1995, a friend offered J.D. a $1,000 to come to Los Angeles and perform a lead role in his play "Dylan's Ghost" at the Morgan-Wixson Theatre in Santa Monica. J.D. took him up on the offer and left college a semester before graduating and since then has lived back and forth between Hollywood, California, Austin, Texas, and Oxford, Mississippi, where he just completed writing and directing his first independent feature _Glorious Mail(2005)_.  Even though he appeared on the short-lived game show, Hollywood Showdown with Todd Newton and won nearly $12,000, his friends like to tell him that he's almost one lucky son of a gun. Mainly because he's come so close to landing lead roles in major films so many times, usually being the director's second choice. In 2004 his luck proved true once again when he purchased a $100 raffle ticket and was 1st Runner Up (2nd Choice) for a $250,000 house in United Way's New Home Giveaway, where instead he won an artist's print worth $80.</biographie>

            <biographie>Escalante Lundy is an American film and television actor and producer, from New Orleans, LA. His most notable role is as "Big Fred" in Quentin Tarantino's Oscar-Nominated film, Django Unchained. Lundy also appears as a prison guard in HBO's Emmy-Nominated television series Treme and in a Pampers commercial with Super Bowl Championship Quarterback, New Orleans Saints' Drew Brees.  Escalante Lundy was born in New Orleans, LA the eldest of five brothers, to Merline (nee' Roy), retired real estate agent, of Rayne, LA, and Hughes Banks Lundy, a salesman from Innis, LA. Lundy graduated from St. Augustine High School, later receiving his Bachelor's degree in Urban Planning from the University of Southwestern Louisiana (USL). Lundy received Masters degrees in Urban Planning and Geographic Information Systems from the University of New Orleans.  Escalante's career began as a stage producer in Sacramento, CA. When an actor failed to show-up, Lundy took the role', garnered success and later decided to focus on acting as a career path. Admittedly, shy by nature, Lundy used acting as a tool to face his fears of public speaking and improve his diction. He continued to hone his acting skills by taking parts in small productions in film and on-stage in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.  Lundy returned to New Orleans in 2005, leaving his position with the California Department of Transportation in Sacramento. Lundy's family members were victims of Hurricane Katrina and his valiant character motivated him to permanently relocate. As the city began to rebuild, Lundy continued to pursue his new found acting passions including focusing on film roles. He studied with renowned acting coaches Veleka Grey (Young and the Restless), Lance Nichols (Curious Case of Benjamin Button and HBO Television Series, Treme) and became a fixture at the acclaimed Jerry Katz Joint (Ivana Chubback Technique). In 2007, Lundy joined the made his New Orleans theatrical debut as co-lead in the production of the "Papaya Man" with the Anthony Bean Community Theater (ABCT)in New Orleans. After having a challenging first rehearsal Lundy says, "I tried to quit but Mr. Bean wouldn't let me. He gave me legs until I was able to run"  In 2012, Lundy made his major motion picture debut as "Big Fred" in Quentin Tarantino's spaghetti western, Django Unchained. Lundy's role as a Mandingo fighter reflects the contrast of the powerlessness of slavery against the super human strength it took to survive such atrocities. Additionally, the grueling fight scenes Lundy appears in are riveting. Although filming the scenes was long and arduous, the efforts paid off. Tarantino directed Lundy in some of the most memorable aspects of the film.</biographie>

            <biographie>Actor/writer/producer Todd Allen counts 'Gregory Peck' (qv), 'Marlon Brando' (qv), 'Steve McQueen (I)' (qv), John Wayne, Alan Ladd, Ward Bond, Lee Marvin and 'Robert Mitchum' (qv) among those actors who both influenced and inspired him to be an actor.  Allen has appeared in over 50 film and television productions and considers himself fortunate to have had the ability and opportunity to work in both film and television. He is filming the inspirational sports drama, "My All American" written and directed by Angelo Pizzo and most recently appeared in Quentin Tarantino's blockbuster Django Unchained as a very Gary Cooper-eque (according to Tarantino) plantation overseer named, "Dollar Bill." In another recent film, Allen completed a starring role in the independent feature, _Frontera (2010)_ (qv), playing a tough, driven Texas Ranger who brings down a powerful drug cartel. The film is yet to be released, but Allen remains hopeful that it will find a market. Recent television appearances include the NBC/Bruckheimer Pilot, _Chase (2010)_ (qv) and a recurring role on _"Friday Night Lights" (2006)_ (qv). Allen also co-starred with 'Robert Duvall' (qv) in Duvall's Academy Award-nominated film, _The Apostle (1997)_ (qv) and, more recently, co-starred with Duvall again in AMC's Emmy Award-winning original mini-series, _"Broken Trail" (2006)_ (qv), playing the well-reviewed role of "Marshal Bill Miller," a man who carries severed human ears on his watch chain. In _American Identity (2007)_ (qv), Allen both produced and co-starred as a battle-hardened Marine Master Sergeant, with a sly sense of humor and a definite command of the battle field, in the deserts of Afghanistan. Other career highlights include three films with 'Lawrence Kasdan' (qv), three films with 'Kevin Costner' (qv), and playing fighter ace 'Chuck Yeager' (qv) in a Hallmark Hall of Fame special presentation. He has many guest-starring roles on television, including appearances on _"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" (2000)_ (qv), _"NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service" (2003)_ (qv), _"Monk" (2002)_ (qv), and a movie for Hallmark entitled _Claire (2007) (TV)_ (qv).  Allen will launch an independent media and production company in 2014 and has a number of exceptional feature film properties and television projects in development. Among them are two film projects he plans to direct. Allen has also written several highly regarded screenplays. His first screenplay, a gritty, film-noir styled Western, "The Deserters", was the subject of much competition among studios but Allen held the project for its original intent which was a starring role for himself. Since Allen is now gray headed and has low back problems, he is now considering directing the film rather than starring in it so he doesn't have to do any more of his own stunts. Other well received screenplays include, "Suicide Grip," a romantic thrill ride set against the exciting backdrop of the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas. "The Empty Quarter," is a cautionary tale set on an explosive gas well in Saudi Arabia's most barren desert and "Rio Grande" is based on the best selling memoir, One Ranger, which details the life and career of a legendary Texas Ranger along the volatile Texas/Mexico border.  Allen maintains residences in Los Angeles and his hometown of Austin, Texas. Flight crews on Southwest Airlines love him.</biographie>

            <biographie>He'll forever be remembered as strapping, good ol' boy Luke Duke, the virile, blue-eyed, dark-haired, plaid-shirted rascal (equally good-looking 'John Schneider (I)' (qv) was the strapping, plaid-shirted blond cousin) on the rough-and-tumble bucolic 80s series _"The Dukes of Hazzard" (1979)_ (qv). Where others may have fallen by the TV wayside, however, after the cancellation of such a popular series, Wopat moved on and reverted back to his first true love - music - successfully refocusing as a recording artist and musical leading man of Broadway and regional shows.  The highly engaging Wisconsin native was born one of six brothers and sisters to a dairy farmer in 1951. Tom began singing and dancing in school musicals from age 12 and, following high school graduation, decided to avidly pursue music as a viable profession. Studying at the University of Wisconsin he dropped out to front a rock band as both guitarist and lead singer, and later gained on-stage experience in such musicals as "South Pacific", "West Side Story" and "Jesus Christ Superstar".  Appearing off-Broadway in 1978 before making his Broadway debut that same year as a replacement actor in the musical "I Love My Wife", other book shows came his way including "The Robber Bridegroom" and the lead in "Oklahoma!" With solid, down-home good looks and appeal, it didn't take long for Hollywood to check him out. By 1979 Tom was co-starring in (and later sometimes directing) episodes of his own popular action-packed series while he and Schneider wrangled heartthrob status in the teen magazines. The backwoods show lasted six seasons, although at one point he and Schneider left the series after contract negotiations broke down. Briefly replaced, the show wasn't the same without them and they eventually were brought back. During the show's run, Tom kick-started his recording career with his first (and self-titled) country album release in 1983. His output went on to include six other country albums before finally releasing a 2000 album of standard love songs.  After the end of his series, Wopat made do in a couple of mini-movie vehicles and a few short-lived series before scoring again on TV as 'Cybill Shepherd' (qv)' ex-husband/stuntman on her own sitcom series in 1995. Better yet, he resharpened his musical theater skills. He returned with commanding baritone leads in "Carousel" (1986), "City of Angels" (1990) and "Guys and Dolls" (1992) (as Skye Masterson). In 1999 he recreated the sharp-shooting Frank Butler role opposite 'Bernadette Peters' (qv) in the popular Broadway revival of "Annie Get Your Gun" and earned a Tony nomination in the process.  It's only gotten sweeter. Guesting for the Cincinnati Symphony and Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestras in programs featuring Broadway's finest music, he has continued on the New York stage with successive roles in "42nd Street" and "Chicago" (as slick lawyer Billy Flynn). In 2005 he more than held his own in his first straight-acting Broadway part as part of the excellent ensemble in the Tony-winning (for "Best Revival of a Play") production of "Glengarry Glen Ross" starring acting heavyweights 'Alan Alda' (qv) and 'Liev Schreiber' (qv). That same year Wopat embarked on a 33-date national "Over The Rainbow" tour with 'Faith Prince' (qv) featuring the gorgeous songs of 'Harold Arlen' (qv), a tour that included Carnegie Hall.</biographie>

            <biographie>He's the son of Vaudeville great, 'Clarence Stroud' (qv), of the Stroud Twins and singer 'Ann McCormack (I)' (qv), who toured the world with 'Frank Sinatra' (qv).  Don grew up on the beach in Honolulu, Hawaii, where his stepfather, 'Paul Livermore' (qv), and his mother, Ann, owned and operated the popular "Embers Steak House" and nightclub where Ann performed nightly. Don thrived on the beach in Waikiki under the watchful eyes of such mentors as Blackout, Mud, Buckshot, Rabbit and Steamboat. He learned much from these famous beach boys and in 1960, at the age of 17, he placed fourth in the "Duke Kahanamoku World Surfing Championship" at Makaha, Hawaii. Don was surfing at Waikiki when he was discovered. Actor 'Troy Donahue' (qv) was filming _"Hawaiian Eye" (1959)_ (qv) and needed a stunt double for his surfing scenes. Don, at 18, 6' 2" and 175 pounds, stepped up and was hired on the spot. He loved the gig so much, he decided to go to Hollywood to give it a try. Upon arriving in L.A., he landed a variety of jobs, including parking cars, bouncer and then manager of the world famous "Whiskey A Go-Go" nightclub on the Sunset Strip, where such greats as 'Janis Joplin' (qv), 'Jimi Hendrix' (qv) and 'Jim Morrison (I)' (qv) of the "Doors" appeared. It was at the "Whiskey" that actor 'Sidney Poitier' (qv) turned Don on to his acting career. Don went on to become one of Hollywood's great heavies and character actors. He has starred in over 100 movies and 175 television shows to date. He has also starred in four television series, notably 'Mickey Spillane' (qv)'s _"Mike Hammer" (1984)_ (qv) with 'Stacy Keach' (qv) and _"The New Gidget" (1986)_ (qv) where he was a natural to play the "Kahuna".</biographie>

            <biographie>Franco Nero, a leading actor in international cinema, was born in Parma (Northern Italy).  His inclination for acting had already become obvious in his teenage years when he began organizing and participating in student plays.  After a short stint at a leading theater school, he moved to Rome where he joined a small group of friends for the purpose of making some documentaries.  Still unsure of his ultimate vocation, he worked various jobs on the crew.  The role as Abel in John Houston's film "The Bible" marked a crucial point in his career.  A few months later he had his big break with the internationally acclaimed cult-classic Spaghetti-Western "Django". The following year Joshua Logan cast him in the film version of "Camelot" (Warner Bros.), opposite Vanessa Redgrave, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe award.  Nero has appeared in more than 195 movies around the world and has worked with Europe's top directors, such as Luis Bunuel, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Claude Chabrol, Sergei Bondarciuk, Michael Cacoyannis, Elio Petri, Marco Bellocchio, Enzo G. Castellari, just to mention a few. He has also payed the roles of leading national heroes, such as "Garibaldi" (Italy), "Arpad" (Hungary", "Banovic Strahinja" (Yugoslavia). In the USA he has been in successful mini-series such as "The Pirate" (Warner Bros), "The Last Days of Pompeii" (CBS), "Young Catherine" (TNT), "Bella Mafia" (CBS), "The Painted Lady", "Saint Augustine", and movies such as "The Legend of Valentino", "21 Hours to Munich", "Force 10 from Navarone", "Enter the Ninja", "The Versace Murder", "Die Hard 2", and recently "Letters to Juliet".  At the beginning of the 80's, he also began producing, writing and directing.  Between films, he participates in various theatrical events.  Over the last 45 years he has been a benefactor of the Don Bosco orphanage in Tivoli.  He has received many awards and in 1992 for his artistic merits a knighthood of the Italian Republic was bestowed on him by the President of Italy.  In 2011 he was honored by Brunel University of London with the honorary degree of doctor of Letters honoris causa and in Toronto with a star on the walk of fame.</biographie>

            <biographie>As an established and extremely talented stunt double, Zoe Bell has made a name for herself through her unparalleled dedication, skills, and focus. Bell debuts her acting career, with her already famous stunt skills, in the highly anticipated double feature _Grindhouse (2007)_ (qv) written by 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv) and 'Robert Rodriguez (I)' (qv). She was hand picked, by Tarentino himself, to star in his segment of the double feature, Death Proof, about four women working on the movie set of their next big hit. All seems to be going well on set until a psychotic killer begins to stalk them.  Bell began working with Tarantino well before Grindhouse hough, in _Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)_ (qv) and _Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)_ (qv) playing the stunt double for Uma Thurman's role, The Bride. Bell was nominated for her work in Kill Bill, Vol. 1 in the categories of Best Stunt by a Stunt Woman and Best Fight for the Taurus World Stunt Awards, both of which she would win the following year for Kill Bill: Vol. 2. Bell also showed off her stunt-woman skills as a double for Sharon Stone in Halle Barry's _Catwoman (2004)_ (qv).  Bell's talent can not only be seen on the big screen but also in the cult television series _"Xena: Warrior Princess" (1995)_ (qv) where she was the stunt double for Lucy Lawless. Bell also appeared as a double in the ABC thriller _"Alias" (2001)_ (qv) and on an episode of Cleopatra 2525 in 2000 as a double for Vicki Pratti.  In the action packed documentary _Double Dare (2004)_ (qv), Bell along with legendary stunt-woman 'Jeannie Epper' (qv) give an insight into the career of women who take falls and punches for a living. Double Dare also gives a glimpse into the struggles of stunt-women to stay thin, employed, and sane in a male dominated career.  Bell, a native of New Zealand, currently resides in Los Angeles but hopes to someday own a home in New Zealand.</biographie>

            <biographie>Few actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio's. DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom _"Growing Pains" (1985)_ (qv) and low budget horror movies, such as _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) and _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as 'Martin Scorsese' (qv) and 'Christopher Nolan (I)' (qv). But such a rich, varied career is what you would expect from someone who has had such an unusual upbring as DiCaprio.  Leonardo DiCaprio is the only child of former comic book artist 'George DiCaprio (I)' (qv) and 'Irmelin DiCaprio' (qv) (both born 1943). Leonardo's father, George, had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late 'Harvey Pekar', a friend of George's. However, Leonardo's performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name "Lenny Williams", DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs. DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in bit part roles in a number of television series, such as _"Roseanne" (1988)_ (qv) and _"The New Lassie" (1989)_ (qv), but it wasn't until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv), a low-budget horror movie.  While _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv) did little to help showcase DiCaprio's acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom _"Growing Pains" (1985)_ (qv), in which Leonardo was cast in the "Cousin Oliver" role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio's stint on _"Growing Pains" (1985)_ (qv) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public's attention and, after the show ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops. Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in _What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)_ (qv), a young gunslinger in _The Quick and the Dead (1995)_ (qv) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, "Jim Carroll", in _The Basketball Diaries (1995)_ (qv), a role which the late 'River Phoenix' (qv) originally expressed interest in.  While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo's reputation as an actor, it wasn't until his role as "Romeo" in 'Baz Luhrmann' (qv)'s _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio's reputation as a teen heartthrob.  Following his work on _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in _The Man in the Iron Mask (1998/I)_ (qv) and the low-budget _The Beach (2000/I)_ (qv) being some of his few notable roles during this period. However, in 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv) and _Gangs of New York (2002)_ (qv), his first of many collaborations with director 'Martin Scorsese' (qv).  With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment.  As someone who has gone from bit parts in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continues to defy conventions about the types of roles he will accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all star casts in action thrillers such as _The Departed (2006)_ (qv), _Shutter Island (2010)_ (qv) and 'Christopher Nolan (I)' (qv)'s _Inception (2010)_ (qv), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any cliché about actors. DiCaprio is not merely a former teen heartthrob turned leading man, he is one of the most respected, daring and challenging actors working today.</biographie>

            <biographie>Russ Tamblyn might as well face it...he will be a Jet "till his last dying day." Indelibly linked to the "womb to tomb" role of Riff, the knife-wielding, rocket-tempered, Baryshnikov-styled gang leader of the streetwise Jets in the musical film masterpiece _West Side Story (1961)_ (qv), it's not a bad way to be remembered! Russ was actually 27 when he portrayed the teenage troublemaker who became the '50s equivalent of the Mercutio character in the Romeo and Juliet-inspired adaptation.  To describe Tamblyn as talented and extremely agile is a huge understatement. This awesome musical performer was born in Los Angeles, California on December 30, 1934, and groomed early for stardom. Discovered at age ten by actor 'Lloyd Bridges (I)' (qv) for the play "Stone Jungle", Russ was soon performing on radio and in L.A.-based musical revues. Billed as "Rusty Tamblyn" then, the tousle-haired scrapper played a student extra in his first film _The Boy with Green Hair (1948)_ (qv) starring another child actor, 'Dean Stockwell' (qv). Having taken up dancing and acrobatics from the age of 6, Tamblyn marked his abilities with his very first TV appearance on the "The Ed Sullivan Show." Eventually handed a starring role in the "B" film _The Kid from Cleveland (1949)_ (qv), he was signed by an eager MGM who saw his potential as a juvenile actor. Featured in the popular family-oriented comedy _Father of the Bride (1950)_ (qv), and its sequel _Father's Little Dividend (1951)_ (qv), Tamblyn also had a prime role in the war drama _Take the High Ground! (1953)_ (qv) before taking off in musical films. Demonstrating exceptional athleticism in one of MGM's best, _Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954)_ (qv), Tamblyn's timing was regrettably off as musicals were quickly on the wane. He adjusted, however. A starring role in the low-budget _The Young Guns (1956)_ (qv) led to excellent reviews in the ensemble box-office soaper _Peyton Place (1957)_ (qv). Tamblyn, along with 'Lana Turner' (qv), 'Arthur Kennedy (I)' (qv), 'Hope Lange' (qv) and 'Diane Varsi' (qv), all received Oscar nominations for their participation. Russ scored quite well in the title role of _tom thumb (1958)_ (qv), which became a large stepping stone in his being cast as Riff in 1961. Following this achievement, however, the offers started dwindling.  Tamblyn's last co-starring roles in quality films were shot overseas with the British-produced chiller _The Haunting (1963)_ (qv) with 'Julie Harris (I)' (qv) and 'Claire Bloom (I)' (qv), and the British-Yugoslavian Viking costumer _The Long Ships (1964)_ (qv) starring 'Richard Widmark' (qv) and 'Sidney Poitier' (qv). After that, his career grew quite dismal. Titles such as _The Female Bunch (1971)_ (qv), _Satan's Sadists (1969)_ (qv), _Scream Free! (1969)_ (qv), _Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1971)_ (qv) and _Blood Screams (1990)_ (qv) pretty much tells the story. On the road in the lean years with minor stage productions here and there, including the musical "Cabaret," Russ all but disappeared from the viewing audience. When he finally nabbed the role of the overtly weird (and who wasn't on that show?) psychiatrist Dr. Lawrence Jacoby in the popular TV cult series _"Twin Peaks" (1990)_ (qv), it was the first time Tamblyn had generated interest in over two decades. Barely recognizable with his wild-eyed look, mangy hair and frizzy beard, he has since gained employment off this eccentric image. Married three times, Tamblyn has lately taken on choreographic duties and the managing of actress/daughter 'Amber Tamblyn' (qv)'s career, she of _"Joan of Arcadia" (2003)_ (qv) fame.</biographie>

            <biographie>In January of 1992, _Reservoir Dogs (1992)_ (qv) appeared at the Sundance Film Festival, by first-time writer-director Quentin Tarantino. The film garnered critical acclaim and the director became a legend immediately. Two years later, he followed up Dogs success with _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv) which premiered at the Cannes film festival, winning the coveted Palme D'Or Award. At the 1995 Academy Awards, it was nominated for the best picture, best director and best original screenplay. Tarantino and writing partner 'Roger Avary' (qv) came away with the award only for best original screenplay. In 1995, Tarantino directed one fourth of the anthology _Four Rooms (1995)_ (qv) with friends and fellow auteurs 'Alexandre Rockwell' (qv), 'Robert Rodriguez (I)' (qv) and 'Allison Anders' (qv). The film opened on December 25th in the United States to very weak reviews. Tarantino's next film was _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv), a vampire/crime story which he wrote and co-starred with 'George Clooney' (qv). The film did fairly well theatrically.</biographie>

            <biographie>William Hudson, an American actor from Chicago, is the son of Michael Hudson, a popular radio disc jockey on Chicago's number one urban station, WGCI 107.5. William attended St. Ignatius high school on West Roosevelt Rd. and played varsity basketball for the Wolfpack. His love and talent for the game ended him up at The University of Miami with the Hurricanes, however after just one year he decided to focus on entertainment instead.  While on a trip to New York City in the summer of 2007 visiting friends of the family, Hudson found himself in the borough of Brooklyn at the exact same time as the academy award winning director, Ridley Scott was filming the 1970's based major motion picture, "American Gangster." Wearing his hair braided in cornrows at the time, Hudson decided to take them out and approach Mr. Scott with his own 70's style afro and ambition. Seeing the determination in Mr. Hudson's eyes and the hairstyle befitting of the period piece, Ridley decided to include William in the film as a drug dealer alongside fellow Chicago native and actor, "Common Sense."  With the successful major motion picture, "American Gangster" under his belt, Mr. Hudson then found himself in Los Angeles, California on an audition for another period piece to be directed by yet another academy award winning director, Quentin Tarantino. The movie was "Django Unchained," and the role was that of the character named, "Blueberry," a slave turned killer deep in the woods of Texas in the year 1861. "Django Unchained" went on the be Mr. Tarantino's highest grossing film to date.  Mr. Hudson still lives in Chicago Illinois.</biographie>

            <biographie>Bruce Dern had established himself as the movies' premier heavy, playing sociopaths, psychotics and just plain criminals by the time he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for _Coming Home (1978)_ (qv). Some perceptive critics had noted that Dern was a finer actor than his roles generally allowed one to believe, repelled as one was by the neurotic persona that Dern was able to project and that casting directors capitalized on.  'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), a close friend, claimed that Dern was the best of the new breed of actors who had been born just before World War II and were coming into their own in the 1970s. Unlike his screen image, Dern had come from a patrician background: his grandfather had been governor of Utah and a secretary of war under 'Franklin D. Roosevelt' (qv). When allowed to step out of his on-screen persona to assay the millionaire Tom Buchanan in the 1974 remake of _The Great Gatsby (1974)_ (qv), he acquitted himself quite well.  Some critics said that "Gatsby" would have been better if Dern rather than 'Robert Redford (I)' (qv) had played the title role. Others pointed to his fine work as Nicholson's brother in _The King of Marvin Gardens (1972)_ (qv) to establish a case that he was an underappreciated and underutilized talent. By the time Dern appeared as the cuckolded Marine in "Coming Home," a consensus had emerged that Dern was a fine actor. He won an Oscar nod for the role, then fell victim to the infamous "Oscar curse" that has claimed other winners, most famously in the case of 1969 Best Supporting Actor winner 'Gig Young' (qv), Dern's co-star in _They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969)_ (qv).  Dern, like Young before him, was determined to break out of supporting roles. Like Young, who had been cast repeatedly as a light comedian in his career, Dern had also become typecast, but as a psycho, surpassing even 'Anthony Perkins (I)' (qv) in those types of roles. Dern was determined to break out of the ghetto he had found himself in before "Coming Home." He failed, and his career suffered.  Up through his Oscar nomination, Dern had starred in 26 films in 11 years since graduating to steady employment in A-pictures with _Waterhole #3 (1967)_ (qv). After the 1979 Oscar nod, he would appear in only a dozen feature films in the next 11 years, not counting TV movies. None of them brought him stardom or much acclaim, and his attempt at becoming a lead man, _Middle Age Crazy (1980)_ (qv), flopped badly (he did received a nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actor at the 1981 Genie Awards, the Canadian equivalent of the Oscars, for his work in that picture). It was back to psychos, this time as a lead, in _Tattoo (1981)_ (qv). The movie proved to be another flop, and his reputation was further damaged when he bragged that he had actually performed on-screen sexual intercourse with co-star 'Maud Adams' (qv), a boast that Adams heatedly denied. Dern's star was seriously dimmed.  Although he landed a coveted role in the film adaptation of 'Jason Miller (I)' (qv)'s Pulitzer Prize-winning play _That Championship Season (1982)_ (qv), the film was a disappointment with critics and at the box office. He turned in a fine performance three years later in the TV movie _Toughlove (1985) (TV)_ (qv), but overall, his career was floundering.  Another psycho role, that of Uncle Bud in _After Dark, My Sweet (1990)_ (qv), started buzz about another possible Best Supporting Oscar nod for him, but the film proved a box-office bust and the nomination never materialized. A predicted career renaissance for Dern faded, just as the careers of his ex-wife, 'Diane Ladd' (qv), and their daughter, 'Laura Dern' (qv), kicked into high gear.  Since the 1990 high point of the second wave of his career, Dern has stayed steadily employed, but has never again generated much critical acclaim, nor made any inroads towards reclaiming his crown as the cinema's premier sociopath. A fine actor, who will be remembered most vividly for such psycho/killer roles such as the rustler leader who gunned down 'John Wayne (I)' (qv) in _The Cowboys (1972)_ (qv), Dern's career serves as a cautionary tale for those actors who try to escape the ghetto of typecasting. While nothing restricts an actor's artistic development as much as typecasting, unless like a Duke Wayne they can turn that type into superstardom, trying to break out of the type can prove to be career suicide.</biographie>

      <titre>Casino Royale</titre>
      <synopsis>Casino Royale introduces James Bond before he holds his license to kill. But Bond is no less dangerous, and with two professional assassinations in quick succession, he is elevated to '00' status. Bond's first 007 mission takes him to Uganda where he is to spy on a terrorist, Mollaka. Not everything goes to plan and Bond decides to investigate, independently of MI6, in order to track down the rest of the terrorist cell. Following a lead to the Bahamas, he encounters Dimitrios and his girlfriend, Solange. He learns that Dimitrios is involved with Le Chiffre, banker to the world's terrorist organizations. Secret Service intelligence reveals that Le Chiffre is planning to raise money in a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro at Le Casino Royale. MI6 assigns 007 to play against him, knowing that if Le Chiffre loses, it will destroy his organization. 'M' places Bond under the watchful eye of the beguiling Vesper Lynd. At first skeptical of what value Vesper can provide, Bond's interest in her deepens as they brave danger together and even torture at the hands of Le Chiffre. In Montenegro, Bond allies himself with Mathis MI6's local field agent, and Felix Leiter who is representing the interests of the CIA. The marathon game proceeds with dirty tricks and violence, raising the stakes beyond blood money and reaching a terrifying climax.</synopsis>

            <biographie>Mads Mikkelsen is a synonym to the great success the Danish film industry has had since the mid-1990s. Starting out as a low-life pusher/junkie in the 1996 success _Pusher (1996)_ (qv), he slowly grew to become one of Denmark's biggest movie actors. The success in his home country includes _Blinkende lygter (2000)_ (qv), _En kort en lang (2001)_ (qv) and the Emmy-winning police series _"Rejseholdet" (2000)_ (qv). His success has taken him abroad where he has played alongside 'Gérard Depardieu' (qv) in _I Am Dina (2002)_ (qv) as well as in the Spanish comedy _Torremolinos 73 (2003)_ (qv) and the American blockbuster _King Arthur (2004)_ (qv).</biographie>

            <biographie>Malcolm Sinclair read drama and theology at the University of Hull and then went on to do a one year post-graduate acting course at Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. After seven years in different repertory companies around the country he made his London debut in 1985 at the Notting Hill Gate Theatre in Arthur Schnitzler's play 'Anatole', which he describes as the first thing that got him noticed. Since then he has appeared with both the National and Royal Shakespeare companies and has taken on musical roles in the likes of 'Privates On Parade' and 'My Fair lady'. On television he has been bumped off several times in who-dunnit mystery dramas though he stayed the course as supercilious Assistant Chief Constable Freddie Fisher in 'Pie In the Sky'. In July 2010 he was elected the president of the Equity actors' union.</biographie>

            <biographie>Daniel Craig, one of British theatre's most famous faces who was waiting tables as a struggling teenage actor with the NYT, went on to star as "James Bond" in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv), _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv) and _Skyfall (2012)_ (qv).  He was born Daniel Wroughton Craig on March 2, 1968, at 41 Liverpool Road, Chester, Cheshire, England. His father, Tim Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, then became landlord of "Ring O' Bells" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia Craig, was an art teacher. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel Craig was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of 6, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of "Oliver!", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv)'s _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.  At the age of 14, Craig played roles in "Oliver", "Romeo and Juliet" and "Cinderella" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral, UK. He left Hilbre High at 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as "Agamemnon" in Shakespeare's "Troilus and Cressida". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director 'Edward Wilson (I)' (qv). He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside 'Ewan McGregor' (qv) and 'Alistair McGowan' (qv), then later 'Damian Lewis (I)' (qv) and 'Joseph Fiennes' (qv), among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of 'Colin McCormack (I)' (qv), the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named 'Ella Craig' (qv), was born in 1992. Daniel Craig made his film debut in _The Power of One (1992)_ (qv). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial _"Our Friends in the North" (1996)_ (qv). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)_ (qv) and _Road to Perdition (2002)_ (qv). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in _Layer Cake (2004)_ (qv), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray "James Bond", in October of 2005, weeks after he finished his work in _Munich (2005)_ (qv), where he co-starred with 'Eric Bana' (qv) under the directorship of 'Steven Spielberg' (qv).  Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool "007". He is the first blonde actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author 'Ian Fleming (I)' (qv) in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: 'Sean Connery' (qv), 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv), 'Timothy Dalton' (qv) and 'Pierce Brosnan' (qv) have indicated that Craig is a good choice as "Bond".</biographie>

            <biographie>Ten years before Czechoslovakia separated, Vlastina was born to Czechoslovakian parents: a Slovak mother and Czech (or shall we say, Moravian) father. She attended elementary and a high school in the Slovak town of Myjava. She studied piano for fifteen years and also took in drawings and singing lessons. She also studied writing and reciting poems. Even though Vlastina had wanted become an actress since childhood, she made two detours along the way. She studied Mass Communication as well as the Commenius University in Bratislava, where she got her Master. Her first feature was Casino Royale by Martin Campbell, where she got a part in the casino. Then she continued in The Red Baron, Dark Spirits, Women in Temptation. She got a role of an American spy in television film The Rhythm at their heels. A story set in the early 1950s, when the communist regime in Czechoslovakia mercilessly wiped out the remaining elements of the free world. A bunch of naive young people associated with a coffee-house jazz band were easy prey for the pitiless State Security men. In 2009 she got a part of a nurse Tereza in thriller Unknown Hour - a not very fictive story of a man, known in fact as "the hospital murderer". In 2010 she started to shoot a historical epic The Danube Saga where she performed the main character of Elena Unger. Saga, a concatenation of stories of one's line. Vlastina is also performing in theater and writing books.</biographie>

Her mother was arrested, and Vera and her sisters spent the rest of the war in Gestapo camps. They were reunited with their mother after the war, but the family was destitute, and ostracised by other Germans for their father's treachery. She ended up studying textile design in Florence, where a fashion designer first asked her to model. She had first travelled to New York in 1961 as plain old Vera, but failed to secure a single booking. After retreating to Milan for a spell, she returned to take Manhattan under her new name....

            <biographie>Quite possibly the most underrated and underexposed actor of his caliber and generation, Jeffrey Wright's undeniable talent and ability to successfully bring to life any role he undertakes is on a par with the most praised and revered A-list actors in the business. Born and raised in Washington DC, Wright graduated from the prestigious Amherst college in 1987. Although he studied Political Science while at Amherst, Wright left the school with something that would prove to be more valuable: a love for acting. Shortly after graduating he won an acting scholarship to NYU, but dropped out after only two months to pursue acting full time. With roles in 1990's Presumed Innocent, and the Broadway production of Angels in America, (in which he won a well deserved Tony award), within a relatively short time Wright was able to show off his exceptional talent and ability on both stage and screen alike. His first major on-screen performance came in 1996 in the Julian Schnabel directed film Basquiat. Wright's harrowing performance as the late painter Jean Michele Basquiat was critically acclaimed for its haunting accuracy and raw emotion. With a Tony, a Golden Globe, and an AFI award under his belt, the intensity of Wright's skill has been proven over and over again. Hopefully the near future will bring an influx of more varied lead roles for black actors so that Wright can continue to astonish his colleagues, critics and fans alike with the intensity of his skill.</biographie>

            <biographie>Simon Abkarian was born Simone Abkarian on March 5, 1962, in Gonesse, a northeastern suburb of Paris, France, into a French - Armenian family. Young Simon Abkarian grew up in a trilingual environment, he learned French at school in addition to his native Armenian, and also learned English by watching American films since he was a kid. He spent most of his childhood in France until the age of nine, then went with his parents to Beirut, Lebanon.  From 1971 to 1977 young Abkarian lived with his mother and father in Lebanon. He studied dancing with the Lori Dance Ensemble in Beirut. There he attended Armenian school and also studied French and English. In 1977, his father went to war in Lebanon, and 15-year-old Abkarian with his mother moved back to Paris. A few years later he moved to New York and continued his studies of dancing and acting at the Antranik company in New York, then moved to Los Angeles, California. In 1983-1985 he studied acting and joined the Armenian Theatre Company Artavadzt of the AGBU under the leadership of director Gerald Papazian. In 1984, he joined the workshop at renown Theatre du Soleil on tour in Los Angeles during the Olympics Art Festival. Abkarian took a month-long acting workshop from Mnouchkine's mask-maker, Georges Bigot, then was auditioned by Ariane Mnouchkine who invited him to join the company. In 1985 Abkarian returned to Paris, France. There he resumed a successful stage acting career, and had an eight-year-long collaboration with Ariane Mnouchkine, the legendary director of Théâtre du Soleil. There he played leading roles in Greek tragedies and became known for his charismatic performances. He also directed several stage plays in Paris, including Shakespeare's 'Love's Labour Lost' at the Bouffles du Nord, and Aeschylus's 'The Last Song of Troy' at Bobigny, among others. In 2001 Abkarian won the highest award in French theatre for an actor - the Prix Molière, for his performance in 'Une Bête Sur La Lune' (aka.. Beast on the Moon). Since 1993, Abkarian and his actress-director wife, Catherine Schaub, started their own theatre T.E.R.A. (Theatre Espace Recherche Acteur) in Paris. There he has been playing and directing classical and contemporary plays. In the season of 2005-2006, he was brought by The Actors' Gang to direct Shakespeare's 'Love's Labor's Lost' in Los Angeles.  Abkarian made his film debut in 1989, in a short film 'Ce qui me meut' by director Cédric Klapisch. During his early film career, Abkarian enjoyed a fruitful collaboration with Cédric Klapisch in 6 French films, becoming noticed in the award winning _Chacun cherche son chat (1996)_ (qv). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of painter Archil Gorky in 'Atom Egoyan' (qv)'s award winning epic _Ararat (2002)_ (qv). Simon Abkarian won awards for his performance as Eliahou in 'To Take a Wife (2004) by director Ronit Elkabetz. That same year Abkarian gave a stellar performance in his first leading role in English, co-starring as He, a passionate Lebanese doctor turned cook who is in love with an American woman (Joan Allen) in _Yes (2004/I)_ (qv) directed by Sally Potter. He made a step forward in his film career with the supporting role as Alex Dimitros in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv), playing in several powerful scenes opposite 'Daniel Craig (I)' (qv).  Simon Abkarian has been generously involved in the humanitarian causes of the Armenian people across the world. He has been a frequent participant, host and presenter at numerous charitable events and ceremonies related to the Armenian causes. He was also a member of French President Jacque Chirac's delegation to Armenia in October of 2006.</biographie>

            <biographie>Lasco Atkins was born in Hong Kong in 1980. At an early age he already knew he loved films, mainly action movies starring Arnie, Sly, JCVD, etc. Once at film school he learned a new appreciation for classics, black &amp; whites, 70s, etc. He re-watched old films such as Blade Runner and no longer thought of them as boring but as visual masterpieces. He started making videos of skits with friends and skateboarding videos. At Art College (Surrey Institute in Farnham) he tried video editing for the first time, where he mainly made OTT videos. At Film School he shot on film stock for the first time and edited on Steen-beck also. He developed a wider understanding and appreciation for how films were/are made. Going in only wanting to be a director, he came out of LFS (London Film School) as a cameraman. Once he left film school, he began focus pulling/camera assistant. Eventually he caught the lighting bug. This is extremely helpful for young DP's since they must have a good knowledge of lights and camera. Occasionally directing, he also acts on bigger budget films. He is happy anywhere on a film set, either in front, behind or anywhere as long as the project is valuable and an experience. Lately he has even tried his hands at rapping, appearing in two of his own music videos this year already (2013) known as Lasco Tobasco.</biographie>

            <biographie>Giancarlo Giannini is an Oscar-nominated Italian actor, director and multilingual dubber who made an international reputation for his leading roles in Italian films as well as for his mastery of a variety of languages and dialects.  He was born August 1, 1942, in La Spezia, Italy. For ten years young Giannini lived and studied in Naples, earning his degree in electronics. At the age of 18 he enrolled in the Academy of Dramatic Art D'Amico in Rome, making his stage acting debut there. His credits included performances in contemporary Italian plays, as well, as in Italian productions of 'William Shakespeare (I)' (qv)'s plays "Romeo and Juliet" and "A Midsummer's Night Dream". In 1965 he made his debut on television starring as David Copperfield in the TV mini-series made by RAI, the Italian national TV company. He made his big-screen debut in _Libido (1965)_ (qv), a Freudian psychological thriller. Since 1966 he has been in a successful collaboration with the legendary Italian director 'Lina Wertmüller' (qv), who made several award-winning films with Giannini as a male lead. He appears as peasant Tonino who prepares to assassinate dictator 'Benito Mussolini' (qv) in _Film d'amore e d'anarchia, ovvero 'stamattina alle 10 in via dei Fiori nella nota casa di tolleranza...' (1973)_ (qv), as a sailor in the irony-laden comedy _Travolti da un insolito destino nell'azzurro mare d'agosto (1974)_ (qv) and as a survivor of a concentration camp in the Oscar-nominated _Pasqualino Settebellezze (1975)_ (qv). He also starred as a Jewish musician arrested by the Nazis in 'Rainer Werner Fassbinder' (qv)'s masterpiece _Lili Marleen (1981)_ (qv).  Giannini also made a reputation for dubbing international stars in films released on the Italian market, such as 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), 'Al Pacino' (qv), 'Michael Douglas (I)' (qv), 'Dustin Hoffman' (qv), 'Gérard Depardieu' (qv) and 'Ian McKellen' (qv), among others. He received a compliment from 'Stanley Kubrick' for his dubbing of Nicholson in _The Shining (1980)_ (qv). Giannini's fluency in English and his mastery of dialects has brought him a number of supporting roles in Hollywood productions, such as _A Walk in the Clouds (1995)_ (qv), _Hannibal (2001)_ (qv), _Darkness (2002)_ (qv) and _Man on Fire (2004)_ (qv), among many others. He appears as Rene Mathis in the 21st James Bond film _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv), and reprises the role in the sequel, _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv).</biographie>

            <biographie>Eva Gaëlle Green was born on July 5, 1980, in Paris, France. She has a non-identical twin sister. Her father, Walter Green, is a dentist who appeared in the 1966 film _Au hasard Balthazar (1966)_ (qv). Her mother, 'Marlène Jobert' (qv), is an actress who retired from acting and became a writer of children's books. Eva's mother was born in Algeria, of Sephardi Jewish heritage (during that time, Algeria was part of France), and Eva's father is of Swedish and French descent. Eva left French school at 17. She switched to English in Ramsgate, Kent, and went to the American School in France for one year. She studied acting at Saint Paul Drama School in Paris for three years, then had a 10-week polishing course at the Weber Douglas Academy of dramatic Art in London. She also studied directing at the Tisch School of Arts at New York University.  She returned to Paris as an accomplished young actress, and played on stage in several theater productions: "La Jalousie en Trois Fax" and "Turcaret". There she caught the eye of director 'Bernardo Bertolucci' (qv). Green followed a recommendation to work on her English. She studied for two months with an English coach before doing _The Dreamers (2003)_ (qv) with 'Bernardo Bertolucci' (qv). During their work Bertolucci described Green as being "so beautiful it's indecent." Green won critical acclaim for her role in _The Dreamers (2003)_ (qv). She also attracted a great deal of attention from male audiences for her full frontal nudity in several scenes of the film. Besides her work as an actress Green also composed original music and recorded several sound tracks for the film score.  After The Dreamers Green's career ascended to the level where she revealed more of her multifaceted acting talent. She played the love interest of cult French gentleman stealer _Arsène Lupin (2004)_ (qv) opposite 'Romain Duris' (qv). In 2005 she co-starred opposite 'Orlando Bloom' (qv) and 'Liam Neeson' (qv) in _Kingdom of Heaven (2005)_ (qv) produced and directed by 'Ridley Scott' (qv). The film brought her a wider international exposure. She turned down the femme fatale role in The Black Dahlia that went to 'Hilary Swank' (qv) because she didn't want to end up always typecast as a femme fatale after her role in The Dreamers. Instead, Eva Green accepted the prestigious role of Vesper Lynd, one of three Bond girls, opposite 'Daniel Craig (I)' (qv) in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv) and became the 5th French actress to play a James Bond girl after 'Claudine Auger' (qv) in _Thunderball (1965)_ (qv), 'Corinne Cléry (I)' (qv) in _Moonraker (1979)_ (qv), 'Carole Bouquet' (qv) in _For Your Eyes Only (1981)_ (qv) and 'Sophie Marceau' (qv) in The World is not enough (1999).  Since her school years Green has been a cosmopolitan multilingual and multicultural person. Yet, since her father always lived in France with them and her mother, she and her twin sister can't speak Swedish. She developed a wide scope of interests beyond her acting profession and became an aspiring art connoisseur and an avid museum visitor. Her other activities outside of acting include playing and composing music, cooking at home, walking her terrier, and collecting art. She shares time between her two residencies, one is in Paris, France, and one in London, England.</biographie>

      <synopsis>When Daniel Ocean is released from prison in New Jersey, his next heist is already planned. Danny's target are three Las Vegas casinos: The Bellagio, the Mirage and the MGM Grand. They all belong to ruthless entrepreneur Terry Benedict, who, by the way, also shows a certain interest in Danny's beautiful ex-wife Tess. During a much-anticipated boxing event (Lennox Lewis vs. Wladimir Klitschko), there will be $150 million in the safe, 70 yards below the strip. So, Danny starts to hire professionals from all over the country: There's the card magician Rusty Ryan, the perfect pickpocket Linus Caldwell and the ingenious pyrotechnician Basher Tarr. Reuben Tishkoff, who lost a casino to Benedict, provides funding, the brothers Virgil and Turk Malloy will drive and help, and Frank Catton, a professional card dealer, gets a job at the casino to watch the routines. Saul Bloom, already retired, will play the rich heavy weaponry dealer and live in the hotel, while Livingston Dell bugs the place to have a look over the shoulders of the security personnel. Finally, the chinese acrobat artist Yen will be the one to move inside the safe before the motion detectors are turned off. There are three rules to be followed: First: no blood. Second: Rob only who deserves it. Third: Do it as if you have nothing to lose. When the day of the boxing event finally draws near, all is set, and Benedict doesn't have a clue - or does he?</synopsis>

            <biographie>Bernard Jeffrey McCollough was born in Chicago in 1957. He grew up in Chicago, in a rougher neighborhood than most others, with a large family living under one roof. This situation provided him with a great insight into his comedy, as his family, and the situations surrounding them would be what dominated his comedy. Mac worked in the Regal Theater, and performed in Chicago parks in his younger days. He became a professional comedian in 1977, at the age of 19. He refused to change his image for television and films, and therefore was not very well known for most of the eighties. In 1992 he made his film debut with a small part with _Mo' Money (1992)_ (qv). This started a plethora of small parts in a string of movies, mostly comedies, including _Who's the Man? (1993)_ (qv), _House Party 3 (1994)_ (qv) and _The Walking Dead (1995)_ (qv). 1995 proved to be a turning point in his career. He did an HBO Special called _"Midnight Mac" (1995)_ (qv), and took a part as Pastor Clever in the Chris Tucker comedy _Friday (1995)_ (qv). Bernie Mac developed a cult following due to the movie and had many small parts since. In 1996 he starred in the memorable 'Spike Lee' (qv) movie _Get on the Bus (1996)_ (qv), and was very funny in _Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996)_ (qv). About this time he had a recurring role in the TV series _"Moesha" (1996)_ (qv). Bernie Mac's star was slowly rising from this point. His next couple of movie parts were more substantial, including _How to Be a Player (1997)_ (qv) and _The Players Club (1998)_ (qv). In 1999 Bernie Mac got his most high profile part up to that point in the film _Life (1999/I)_ (qv) starring 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv).  The new century started a new era for the brash Chicago comedian. He was a featured comedian in _The Original Kings of Comedy (2000)_ (qv). This performance made him more of a household name, and led to many more major parts. In 2001 he played Martin Lawrence's uncle in _What's the Worst That Could Happen? (2001)_ (qv) and later that year, was in the star studded remake of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv). However his biggest success was _"The Bernie Mac Show" (2001)_ (qv), which debuted in 2001 to instant acclaim. However, soon after the series ended, Mac's health took a turn for the worse. He developed sarcoidosis, an autoimmune disease which causes inflammation in the lungs. On August 9, 2008, after weeks of unsuccessful treatments, Bernie Mac died at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was 50.  Bernie Mac was a comedian that refused to change his image for Hollywood and said that his life in Chicago was who he was and there was nothing that could change that. He was a mature comedian who was very intelligent and very engaging in his TV, movie and stand-up appearances.</biographie>

            <biographie>Eydie Gorme was born in New York on August 16, 1928 to Sephardic Jewish parents. Her father, Nessim Garmezano, was a tailor, from Sicily, who changed his last name when he arrived in the United States. Gorme began singing straight out of high school, with various big bands. But her big break came after she auditioned for, and joined, "The _"Tonight!" (1953)_ (qv) Show" in 1953. There, for $90 a week, she sang solos and sang duets with the up-and-coming 'Steve Lawrence (I)' (qv). The two performed on the show for five years, and married in 1957. After their "Tonight Show" stint, the pair had a short-lived TV show of their own, _"The Steve Lawrence-Eydie Gorme Show" (1958)_ (qv). Then, Lawrence entered the Army leaving Gorme, a new mother, to frequent the night club circuit on her own. Two years later, when Lawrence was discharged, the couple came to a decision to enter show business more professionally. Their career took off, with audiences drawn to their penchant for the classics in favor of rock 'n' roll, as well as their spontaneous banter.</biographie>

            <biographie>Born in Lexington, Kentucky, as son of 'Nick Clooney' (qv), a TV newscaster of many years, who hosted a talk show at Cincinnati and often invited George into the studios already at the age of 5. Avoiding competition with his father, he quit his job as broadcast journalist after a short time.  George studied for a few years at Northern Kentucky University. He failed to join the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. He came to acting when his cousin, 'Miguel Ferrer (I)' (qv), got him a small part in a feature film. After that, in 1982, he moved to Los Angeles and tried for a whole year to get a role while he slept in a friend's closet. His first movie, together with 'Charlie Sheen' (qv), stayed unreleased but got him the producers' attention for later contracts.</biographie>

            <sexe valeur="MASCULIN"/>
            <biographie>Gregory Stenson grew up on the mean streets of Las Vegas, Nevada. Today we know him as the 6 foot box-office hero, but his growth spurt didn't occur to late in his teen years, thus his small size made him a target for bullies. The brutalities he endured as a youngster only made him stronger however and has helped to make him the person he is today. Greg has two loving parents and did the best they could with their lower class status. Gregory hated that his family didn't have all the things they would like to, things they saw while watching programs like The Jefferson's and Goodtimes. He wished his family could have such luxuries and live like these TV families did. His major goal in life became to do the best he could to make his families life the best it could possibly be!  His grades in school were never the best, and Gregory couldn't see himself as a suit anyway, so Gregory looked to other avenues to achieve his goal. It was about this time that his body caught up with and surpassed the size of his classmates, and it wasn't long before the coach of his High School Football Team noticed Gregory on campus. Greg took to Football like a fish to water and excelled greatly, his skills as a Line Backer helped drive his team to two State Championship wins. By his senior year Greg was a hot commodity and had scouts from colleges all over the country looking him over. Greg took his time deciding on who he should go with and finally decided on Antelope Valley College in beautiful Lancaster, California and the outstanding Marauders Football Team. While an odd choice it was nonetheless the one that Gregory made. His reasoning better to be a big fish in a small pond than a big fish in a much larger pond! His talents as a Line Backer once again proved strong here as they did in High School. He brought many victories to his team the Marauders through his tenure with them and was on the Fast Track to an NFL Career when tragedy struck in one the most prolific games of his college career. During the third down as the Quarter Back was looking for a clear Receiver and a shot to bring the team to victory, Gregory was holding the line with all he had. He had already held off to heavy blitzes on his QB but the last push was too much and he was overrun by two Rushers and was left lying on the ground after the play was through. Gregory didn't get up and his teammates ran to his side, where they found him screaming in agony.  Gregory was rushed to the local hospital where it was found that his Bicep muscle was entirely ripped from his bone. A terrible injury to have and one that took many months of reconstructive surgery and therapy to correct. Unfortunately this spelled the end of Gregory's football career as the doctor told him one more injury like this and they don't know what would happen!  Greg became disillusioned with life and fell into a very dark period in his life, (little is known about this part of his life?) but re-emerged a year later with new determination and with his original goal of a better life for himself and his family at the forefront once more. Gregory had endless nights without sleep trying to figure out how he could make his dream come true, then it hit him like a blitz from a forward in his football days. While thinking about the TV shows he loved so much as a kid, he thought he could play those parts as good if not better than say J.J. did on Goodtimes. So with a new resolve he decided to be an actor.  Just as Gregory had chosen an obscure approach to his Football College Career, he again chose the same method on his way to his Hollywood Movie Actor Career. Gregory didn't head to Los Angeles or New York as most people do, instead he went to back to Sin City itself, Las Vegas. He knew that more and more movies were being shot there and decided that a big fish in a smaller pond was good enough for him this time as well. He signed with many different agencies as soon as he arrived back in Vegas and not surprisingly was given a very warm reception. His good looks and boyish charm did very well for Gregory indeed. As his agents looked for work for him, sometimes staying up very late to make sure Gregory was looked at seriously for some of the bigger roles, Gregory knew he couldn't just wait for that "right" acting role to come along so he branched off to "character acting."  His agents found him work at The Aladdin Casino playing a Genie. Greg enjoyed this work immensely, he loved it when the tourists would smile at him and ask for a photo with him, he thought to himself, "Well if this is what its like to be a big-time movie actor, I think I'm gonna love it." While playing the Genie he continually went out on auditions, sometimes he would miss some of his work playing Genie, but his producers understood his need to move his career along and gave him time off as needed. While he had not won any parts on the screen or TV yet, he continually tried, knocking down many barriers as he tried. After a year of playing Genie he thought he had explored all the realms of the character so he decided he needed something fresh as it wasn't fair to him or "Genie" to keep playing a character he saw as "evolved". So without another job to go to he bid the Aladdin farewell.  But it wasn't long before Caesar's Palace heard Gregory was available and immediately made an offer to him to play "Marc Anthony" at their casino. Gregory couldn't believe his luck, the role of Marc Anthony was one of the most sought-after roles in Vegas. Here he was being offered the role without even an audition! Gregory loved his new role and explored all facets of the character in his day to day workings.  Greg's movie career also got a shot in the arm at this time as well. One of his agents found him a very small role in the comedy hit "Bubble Boy". Greg played of all things a security guard in this picture, having never had any experience as a security guard in real life, he learned all he could about his role, going as far as doing temp work as one, before filming started to get an idea of what the character should be about. When the time came to shoot Gregory was more than ready, and brought to the part more that even the writer had hoped to see. Gregory was on his way!  While he continued his Marc Anthony role he went for more and more auditions, picking up a commercial or music video starring role along the way. Gregory's biggest break came when "Bubble Boy" was released and one of the producers assistants of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv), 'Harvey Weintrapper' saw Gregory and his performance. In the script of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) there was a part for a white security officer, and this part was very critical to the unfolding of the whole plot of the movie. Weintrapper called Gregory in and gave him a shot at the part, Gregory with all his zeal again researched the part prior to the meeting. To understand the role he shadowed one of Caesar's Hotel security men for a day to see what it was all about. When Gregory read the part, Weintrapper was blown away, he had expected a great read from Gregory but this was beyond all expectations. Even though Gregory differed from the original characters concept, they decided to take a chance.  _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) became a stunning hit spectacular and owed this in no small way to Gregory Stenson's portrayal of The Sentry in his stunning scene that featured him along with two actors each from a Dynasty of acting Royalty. Gregory's role paired him up against the dynamic Scott Caan (James Caan's Son) and Casey Affleck (Ben Affleck's Brother and best buddy as well of Matt Damon). Both Scott and Casey were most impressed with Gregory's work and invited him to hang out with them after the shoot thus beginning a friendship that lasts to this day. It is a little known secret around insider circles that the three of them are looking at a "western" script to do together.</biographie>

            <biographie>American actor Casey Affleck has an onscreen career dating back to 1988, but his Academy Award nominated work in _The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)_ (qv) gained him wider acclaim in recent years.  Affleck, the younger brother of 'Ben Affleck' (qv), was born Caleb Casey McGuire Affleck-Boldt on 12 August 1975 in Falmouth, Massachusetts to middle-class parents; his mother was a school district employee and teacher, and father was a drug counselor who also served as a social worker, auto mechanic, custodian and bartender. He was also part of the Theater Company of Boston.  Affleck appeared in various roles on television while finishing high school and attending university, including as young Robert Kennedy in the TV mini-series _"The Kennedys of Massachusetts" (1990)_ (qv). After graduating high school, he attended George Washington University and eventually transferred into Columbia University in New York, but he never earned his Bachelor's degree.  Affleck's first major film role was in 'Gus Van Sant' (qv)'s _To Die For (1995)_ (qv), in which he co-starred with his future brother-in-law 'Joaquin Phoenix' (qv) and 'Nicole Kidman' (qv). He would go on to appear in two films with his brother, _Chasing Amy (1997)_ (qv) and _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), which 'Ben Affleck' (qv) co-wrote with 'Matt Damon' (qv). Affleck then chose a variety of roles, most of which were considered to be commercial failures, including _Drowning Mona (2000)_ (qv), a modern version of _Hamlet (2000)_ (qv) and _Soul Survivors (2001)_ (qv). He also co-wrote the screenplay _Gerry (2002)_ (qv) with 'Gus Van Sant' (qv) and 'Matt Damon' (qv), which received a limited release in the United States.  But 2001 brought Affleck a plum role as part of Ocean's Eleven's ensemble cast. Affleck's character, a getaway driver named Virgil Malloy, reappeared in _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv) and _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv). Affleck also received positive critical notice for his work in _Gone Baby Gone (2007)_ (qv), and directed 'Joaquin Phoenix' (qv) in the "hoax-umentary" _I'm Still Here (2010/I)_ (qv). He also recently co-starred in the ensemble comedy _Tower Heist (2011)_ (qv).  Affleck has signed on to star in the independent movie _Ain't Them Bodies Saints (2013)_, described as a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-inspired tale about an escaped convict on the run through Texas, trying to reunite with his wife and daughter. He is married 'Summer Phoenix' (qv), to whom he was introduced by her brother Joaquin. The couple has two sons.</biographie>

After appearing in dozens of local commercials, Scott landed the part of "State Trooper" on the WB TV series "The Strip", his first SAG part, and later joked with Carl saying, "If didn't get that part, I shouldn't be acting". He was catching the eyes of prominent Vegas casting directors, most notably, Ray Favaro and Merilee Lear and movie auditions began to come his way. Steven Soderbergh personally thanked Scott for making the Ocean's Eleven Airport Scene spectacular. As an honorably retired State Trooper, Scott gives law enforcement roles added realism and performs them flawlessly. He is sure, the best is yet to come!</biographie>

            <biographie>Carl Reiner is a legend of American comedy, having achieved great success as a comic actor, a director, producer and recording artist. He has won nine Emmy Awards, three as an actor, three as a writer and two as a producer. He also won a Grammy Award for his "10,000 Year Old Man" album, based on his comedy routine with 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv).  Reiner was born in The Bronx. His father Irving, a Romanian immigrant, was a watchmaker; his mother, Bessie (née Mathias), had been born in Austria. At the age of 16, while working as a sewing machine repairman, he attended a dramatic workshop sponsored by the Works Progress Administration. The direction of his life was set.  In the 1970s, some sources claimed that Reiner made his movie debut in _New Faces of 1937 (1937)_ (qv), but that is unlikely as he would have only been 15-years-old at the time. (Interesting, that movie shares the same plot as his erstwhile partner 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv)' 1968 classic, _The Producers (1967)_ (qv), with a crooked producer planning to fleece his "angels" by producing a flop and absconding with the money). He didn't appear on screen, silver or small, until he made his TV debut in 1948 in the short-lived TV series, _"The Fashion Story" (1948)_ (qv), then became a regular, the following year, on _"The Fifty-Fourth Street Revue" (1949), another TV series with a brief life.  Reiner made his Broadway debut in 1949 in the musical "Inside U.S.A.", a hit that ran for 399 performances. His next Broadway show, the 1950 musical revue, "Alive and Kicking", was a flop, lasting just 43 performances. 'Max Liebman' (qv), the producer/director/writer/composer, had been called in to provide additional material after the show's troubled six week out-of-town preview in Boston. It didn't help -- the show closed after six weeks on Broadway -- but an important contact had been made.  Leibman was a producer-director on _"Your Show of Shows" (1950)_ (qv), one of the great TV series, and he hired Reiner to appear on the show in the middle of its first season. Reiner's first gig on the revue-like show was interviewing "The Professor", a character played by 'Sid Caesar' (qv). He became central to the comedy portions of the show and, in 1953, he racked up the first of six Emmy nominations for acting. (In all, he was nominated for an Emmy Award a total of 13 times). When, in 1954, "Your Show of Shows" was split up by the network into its constituent parts, Reiner continued on with Sid in _"Caesar's Hour" (1954)_ (qv). ('Imogene Coca' (qv) was given her own show, which lasted one season, and Leibman was allowed to produced specials).  "Your Show or Shows" had been a Broadway-style revue, featuring skits such as dancing (including a young 'Bob Fosse' (qv)) whereas "Caesar's Hour" was pure comedy. "Your Show of Shows" had had a great cast, another other than Coca, most of the cast, including Reiner, 'Howard Morris (I)' (qv), and 'Nanette Fabray' (qv) (who went on to win an Emmy) moved over to "Caesar's Hour". In his three seasons on the show, he was nominated three more times for a Best Supporting Actor Emmy, winning twice in 1957 and 1958. But it was its stable of comedy writers that was essential to the great success of both "Your Show of Shows" and "Caesar's Hour". In addition to 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv), the writing staff included 'Neil Simon (I)' (qv), his brother 'Danny Simon (I)' (qv), 'Larry Gelbart' (qv) and 'Mel Tolkin' (qv). (There are rumors that the young 'Woody Allen' (qv) served as the writing staff's typist).  Reiner had sat in informally with the writers during "Your Show of Shows", but he began writing formally for "Caesar's Hour", having learned his craft from all of the other writers. As a self-described uncredited "writer without portfolio", he was able to leave writers' meetings at 6 PM, if he wanted to. This gave him the time to work on a semi-autobiographical novel. Published in 1958, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv) is about a young man in 1930s New York trying to make it in show business. It was transformed into a play and, eventually, adapted into a movie in 1967, and a musical, many years later.  In 1959, he created the pilot for a TV series, "Man of the House", in which he would play a writer, "Rob Petrie", who balanced his family life with the demands of working as a writer for a comedy show headlined by an egotistical comedic genius modeled after 'Sid Caesar' (qv) (a "benign despot" who lacked social skills, according to Reiner). The series was rooted in his experience on "Your Show of Shows" and "Caesar's Hour". The network didn't pick up the pilot at first, as CBS executives claimed the main character, which was clearly autobiographical on Reiner's part, was too New York, too Jewish and too intellectual. In 1960, Reiner teamed up with 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv) on _"The Steve Allen Show" (1956)_ (qv), and their routine "The 2000 Year Old Man" was a huge success. Reiner played the straight man to Brooks in the routine, which was spun-off into five comedy albums, bringing them a Grammy Award. They also made an animated TV special based on their shtick in 1975.  Though CBS turned down "Man of the House", with the two-time Emmy-winning comedian Reiner as the lead, it was still interested in the series. However, they wanted a WASP in the role of "Rob Petrie" to ensure the broad appeal of the show, and the casting of the protagonist came down to 'Johnny Carson (I)' (qv) and 'Dick Van Dyke' (qv). Carson was a game show host of no great note at the time, but Van Dyke was in the smash Broadway musical, _Bye Bye Birdie (1963)_ (qv), for which he won a Tony Award. He got the part and another chapter of TV history was made, when 'Mary Tyler Moore' (qv), 'Rose Marie (I)' (qv) and 'Morey Amsterdam' (qv) all were cast in leading roles. Reiner, himself, would eventually play the role of "Alan Brady", the abrasive 'Sid Caesar' (qv)-like comic convinced of his own genius, in the last few seasons of the series' five-year run.  Another milestone in TV comedy, _"The Dick Van Dyke Show" (1961)_ (qv), brought Reiner five more Emmies, three for writing and two as the producer of the series. In 1966, Reiner and the other principals, including executive producer 'Sheldon Leonard' (qv) and Dick Van Dyke, decided to end the series at the height of its popularity and critical acclaim. (The show won Emmies as best show and best comedy in 1965 and 1966, respectively). Twenty-nine years after the show was ended, Reiner reprised the role of "Alan Brady" on _"Mad About You" (1992)_ (qv), winning his eighth (and so far, last) Emmy Award, this time as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.  It was on "The Dick Van Dyke Show" that Reiner first became a director. His feature film debut, as a director, was with the film adaptation of the play 'Joseph Stein' (qv) had adapted from his 1958 novel, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv). His work as a writer-director, with 'Dick Van Dyke' (qv), in creating a 'Stan Laurel' (qv)-type character in _The Comic (1969)_ (qv) was not a success, but _Where's Poppa? (1970)_ (qv) became a cult classic and _Oh, God! (1977)_ (qv), with 'George Burns (I)' (qv), and _The Jerk (1979)_ (qv), with 'Steve Martin (I)' (qv), were smash hits. The last movie he directed was the 1997 comedy, _That Old Feeling (1997)_ (qv).  Reiner's career has continued on into the 21st Century, when most of his contemporaries had retired. He was awarded the 'Mark Twain' (qv) Prize for American Humor in 2000 and, starting in 2001, he acted in the remake of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) and its two sequels. Most recently, he has appeared as a voice artist in the animated series, _"The Cleveland Show" (2009)_ (qv) (he even wrote an episode for the series rooted in his "Your Show of Shows" experience) and has appeared as a regular on the TV series, _"Hot in Cleveland" (2010)_ (qv) (with fellow nonagenarian 'Betty White (I)' (qv)), as well as appeared on an episode of _"Parks and Recreation" (2009)_ (qv) in 2012.</biographie>

            <biographie>After a long amateur career that included a gold medal winning performance in the 1988 Seoul Olympics that came in the form of a KO of 'Riddick Bowe' (who also went on to win the world heavyweight crown), former undisputed world heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis turned professional in 1989. His 2 round win over Canadian boxer Donnovan Ruddock in Oct of 1992 gained him recognition as a threat among the tough heavyweight ranks. Lewis, a citizen of England and Canada, was slated for a shot at the winner of 'Evander Holyfield' (qv) vs Riddick Bowe. Bowe, a victim of a brutal knockout suffered at the hands of Lewis in the amateur ranks, refused to live up to his end of the bargain by not giving Lewis a well-deserved title shot and infamously tossed the WBC title in a garbage bin. This act prompted the WBC commission to strip Bowe and crown Lewis as the new WBC champion. Lennox Lewis went on to defend the crown for several fights until he was defeated by Oliver McCall in 2 rounds in Sept of 1994. Lewis, with the help of new trainer 'Emanuel Steward' (qv), came back and began tearing his way through the ranks of the heavyweight division. Lewis was again denied a title shot when champion 'Mike Tyson (I)' (qv) relinquished his WBC title to fight 'Evander Holyfield' (qv) rather than risk his titles against Lewis. Lewis recaptured the vacant WBC title by beating his conquerer Oliver McCall in a rematch. Lewis, after defeating every top contender thrown his way, was given his shot at 'Evander Holyfield' (qv) in a championship unification fight on March 13, 1999. Lewis dominated the fight but due to controversial judging, the bout was declared a draw. Lewis defeated 'Evander Holyfield' (qv) in a rematch on Nov 13, 1999 to become undisputed world champion. Due to promoter 'Don King (I)' (qv)'s underhanded tactics, the WBA belt was stripped from Lewis in court. Lewis went on to beat every mandatory challenger while keeping his crown. While avidly issuing challenges to reluctant contender 'Mike Tyson (I)' (qv), Lewis went to Johannesburg in South Africa at the invitation of 'Nelson Mandela' (qv). Lewis would defend his titles against supposed low-risk opponent Hasim Rahman. Due to Lewis' failure to prepare for the fight by dropping excessive weight rapidly, arriving in Johannesburg 2 weeks before the fight which, according to expert opinion, was too late to acclimatize to the thin air since Johannesburg was 5,000 feet above sea level, Lewis suffered one of the biggest upsets in boxing history. However, Lewis has had his rematch with Hashim Rahman and won the title back, and he also fought 'Mike Tyson (I)' (qv) and beaten him 'easily' in 8 rounds.</biographie>

            <biographie>Muscular, swaggering and tough, Scott Caan gives every indication of becoming a "man's-man" like his father, legendary actor 'James Caan (I)' (qv). While it is obvious that he admires tough method actors like 'Marlon Brando' (qv) and 'Sean Penn (I)' (qv), Scott also has a strong egalitarian streak, evidenced by his reasoning for baring his body in films. He is quoted as saying that originally only the women in the scene were to be nude, but that he felt it really sexist, so he stripped too.  Scott was born on August 23, 1976 in Los Angeles, California. He spent his childhood being shuttled between his parent's homes. His mom is actress and model 'Sheila Ryan (II)' (qv); the Caans divorced when Scott was a year old. He has an older half-sister, Tara, and three younger half-brothers: Alexander, Jacob, and James.  Self-desribed as a bad kid who was always getting into trouble, Scott initially steered clear of acting, opting to play sports instead. Scott benefited from his father's hands-on approach to child rearing; the elder Caan reportedly took a five-year hiatus to coach all of his son's little league teams. He also pursued his love of hip-hop by forming a group with his friend 'The Alchemist' (qv); as The Whooliganz, the duo made inroads on the music scene and signed an ill-fated contract with Tommy Boy Records.  It did not take long for Scott to appear in front of the camera; in 1995, he took roles in a couple independent films, _Aaron Gillespie Will Make You a Star (1995)_ (qv) and _A Boy Called Hate (1995)_ (qv). Critical of his performances, Scott enrolled at Playhouse West in Los Angeles to study acting. Roles in more indies followed, including _Bongwater (1997)_ (qv) and 'Gregg Araki' (qv)'s _Nowhere (1997)_ (qv).  His first major film was also a hit; he had a supporting role in _Enemy of the State (1998)_ (qv) for director 'Tony Scott (I)' (qv). He then appeared (in the buff) in _Varsity Blues (1999)_ (qv) as a wisecracking receiver. By now, Scott had built a reliable reputation for playing strong-minded characters with a sense of humor, exemplified by his work in movies such a _Boiler Room (2000)_ (qv), _Ready to Rumble (2000)_ (qv), and his second hit picture, _Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000)_ (qv).  Scott's star rose with a fun supporting turn in 'Steven Soderbergh' (qv)'s _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) remake. At this time he had more indie turns in the films _American Outlaws (2001)_ (qv), _Novocaine (2001)_ (qv), and _Sonny (2002)_ (qv) - 'Nicolas Cage' (qv)'s directorial debut starring 'James Franco' (qv). Scott followed up with his own directorial outing, _Dallas 362 (2003)_ (qv).  Scott reprised his role as Turk Malloy in _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv), then took a supporting roles in two very different pictures: the sexy, ocean-bound thriller _Into the Blue (2005)_ (qv) and in 'Nicole Holofcener' (qv)'s indie comedy, _Friends with Money (2006)_ (qv). 2006 marked Caan's return to the director¹s chair, with _The Dog Problem (2006)_ (qv), and soon was back for _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv).  Over the past few years, Scott made memorable appearances as a recurring character on _"Entourage" (2004)_ (qv). Currently, he has a starring role in the remake of the TV series _"Hawaii Five-0" (2010)_ (qv).  Scott has also established himself as a photographer, having been mentored in the medium by cinematographer 'Phil Parmet' (qv). In 2009, he published his book, Scott Caan Photographs, Vol. 1.</biographie>

            <biographie>Angie Dickinson was born in Kulm, North Dakota, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. L. H. Brown. Mr. Brown was the publisher of The Kulm Messenger. The family left North Dakota in 1942 when Angie was 11 years old, moving to Burbank, California. In December 1946, when she was a senior at Bellamarine Jefferson High School in Burbank, she won the Sixth Annual Bill of Rights Contest. Two years later, her sister Janet did likewise. Being the daughter of a printer, Angie at first had visions of becoming a writer, but gave this up after winning her first beauty contest. After finishing college, she worked as a secretary in a Burbank airplane parts factory for 3-1/2 years. In 1953, she entered the local Miss America contest one day before the deadline and took second place. In August of the same year, she was one of five winners in a beauty contest sponsored by NBC and appeared in several television variety shows. She got her first bit part in a Warner Brothers film in 1954 and gained fame in the television series _"The Millionaire" (1955)_ (qv) and got her first good film role opposite 'John Wayne (I)' (qv) and 'Dean Martin (I)' (qv) in _Rio Bravo (1959)_ (qv). Her success then spiraled until she became one of the nation's top movie stars.</biographie>

            <biographie>J.P. Manoux grew up on the beaches of Santa Barbara, California, the oldest of seven. He was involved in children's theatre productions and took tap dance lessons before attending the Thacher School in Ojai, California. Curiously, that tiny boarding school would provide no less than 3 doctors for NBC's long running hospital drama ER (Noah Wyle and Leland Orser, the other two). As college applications approached, Manoux's drama teacher recommended the undergraduate theatre department at Northwestern University.  Surrounded by Chicago's vibrant theatre scene, J.P. became passionate about improv and sketch comedy. Upon graduating and moving to Hollywood, he sharpened his own comedy chops at L.A. Theatresports, ACME Comedy Theatre, The Groundlings School, and I.O. West. Legit stage productions garnered critical accolades, culminating in 1999 with L.A. Ovation and Backstage West Garland Awards recognizing his work in the world premiere stage musical Reefer Madness.  Over the next few years, J.P. appeared in dozens of TV sitcoms and national commercials including campaigns for Got Milk? and Fruit of the Loom. He was a regular improviser and sketch player on ABC's 2001 prime-time variety experiment The Wayne Brady Show and he became a celebrity in the world of children's television thanks to his dual role as "Mr. Hackett" and "Curtis the Caveman" on the Disney Channel series Phil of the Future. During this period, he also voiced the lead role of "Kuzco" in Disney's animated series The Emperor's New School. In 2006, J.P. joined the ensemble of ER, recurring as surgical resident Dustin Crenshaw. It would prove to be a shrewd casting move, widely regarded (in the Manoux household) as the single most significant factor in returning the venerable series to its original acclaim, prestige, and sex appeal.  Opportunities to act and direct in Canada led Manoux to pursue immigration north of the border. The Toronto based productions of DisneyXD's sci-fi/adventure series Aaron Stone and Teletoon's hybrid animation comedy series Mud pit saw him working both in front of and behind the camera. Still a U.S. citizen, but now a permanent resident of Canada, Manoux routinely hops the border for film and television work, including his recurring role on Community as "The Deanelganger". He hopes to continue spending summers in Toronto, acting in the new CTV multi-camera sitcom Spun Out which stars Dave Foley of The Kids in the Hall and Newsradio fame.  J.P. Manoux has appeared in over 30 feature films, 90 different television series, and 90 commercials. He has provided voice and motion capture performance for 8 video games, competed as a contestant or celebrity panelist on 6 gameshows, read 2 original pieces for All Things Condsidered on National Public Radio, co-written 1 play, and anonymously authored 1 biography.</biographie>

            <biographie>Henry Silva was born on September 15, 1928 in Brooklyn, New York City. He quit public school to attend drama classes at age 13, supporting himself as a dishwasher in a Manhattan hotel. By 1955, Silva had moved up from dishwasher to waiter, and felt ready to audition for the Actors Studio. He was one of five students chosen out of more than 2500 applicants. When the Actors Studio staged 'Michael V. Gazzo' (qv)'s play "A Hatful of Rain" as a classroom project, it proved so successful it came to Broadway--with students 'Ben Gazzara (I)' (qv), 'Shelley Winters' (qv), 'Harry Guardino' (qv), 'Anthony Franciosa (I)' (qv) and, of course, Silva in key roles. Called to Hollywood, he played a succession of heavies in films, including _The Bravados (1958)_ (qv), _Green Mansions (1959)_ (qv), _Ocean's Eleven (1960)_ (qv), _The Manchurian Candidate (1962)_ (qv) and _Johnny Cool (1963)_ (qv).  An Italian producer made Henry an offer he could not refuse--to star as a hero for a change--and he moved his family overseas. Silva's turning-point picture was a spaghetti western, _Un fiume di dollari (1966)_ (qv), which made him a hot box office commodity in Spain, Italy, Germany and France. His popularity was enhanced by a gift for languages. He speaks Italian and Spanish fluently and has a flair for the kind of gritty, realistic roles that also catapulted 'Charles Bronson (I)' (qv) to European stardom. Returning to the United States, he co-starred with 'Frank Sinatra' (qv) in the film _Contract on Cherry Street (1977) (TV)_ (qv), then signed on as Buck Rogers' evil adversary Kane in _Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (1979) (TV)_ (qv) and the television series of the same name. Silva now calls the San Fernando Valley home, but makes continual film forays back to Europe's production centers. A dedicated jogger, he puts in five miles a day "to keep in shape and relieve tension".</biographie>

            <biographie>Julia Fiona Roberts, born in Smyrna, Georgia, never dreamed she would become the most popular actress in America. As a child, due to her love of animals, Julia originally wanted to be a veterinarian, but later studied journalism. When her brother, 'Eric Roberts (I)' (qv), achieved some success in Hollywood, Julia decided to try acting. Her first break came in 1988 when she appeared in two youth-oriented movies _Mystic Pizza (1988)_ (qv) and _Satisfaction (1988)_ (qv). The movies introduced her to a new audience who instantly fell in love with this pretty woman. Julia's biggest success was in the signature movie _Pretty Woman (1990)_ (qv), for which Julia got an Oscar nomination, and also won the People's Choice award for Favorite Actress. Even though Julia would spend the next few years either starring in serious movies, or playing fantasy roles like Tinkerbell, the movie audiences would always love Julia best in romantic comedies. With _My Best Friend's Wedding (1997)_ (qv) Julia gave the genre fresh life that had been lacking in Hollywood for some time. Offscreen, after a brief marriage, Julia has been romantically linked with several other actors. Julia has also become involved with UNICEF charities and has made visits to many different countries, including Haiti and India, in order to promote goodwill. Julia is one of the most popular and sought-after talents in Hollywood.</biographie>

            <biographie>Matthew Paige Damon, or better known to fans as Matt Damon was born in Boston Massachusetts, USA to 'Kent Damon' (qv), a stockbroker, Realtor and tax preparer, and 'Nancy Carlsson-Paige' (qv), an early childhood education professor at Lesley University. Matt has an older brother named Kyle who is now a sculptor. Unfortunately for Matt and his brother, their parents divorced in the year 1973.  The 5'10" star is of English, Scottish, Finnish, and Swedish ancestry. While his parents were still together, their family lived in Newton, before eventually settling for a divorce, where Damon and his brother moved with his mother to Cambridge. He grew up in a stable community back in Massachusetts. Matt also grew up near actor 'Ben Affleck' (qv), when he was younger.  Matt attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School which is located in Cambridge and he performed in a number of theater productions during his time there. Later on, he was accepted into Harvard University as an English major in the fall of 1988 and was supposed to graduate with the class of 1992. While in Harvard, he kept on skipping classes to pursue acting projects, which included the TNT original film, _Rising Sun (1993)_ (qv), and prep-school drama, _School Ties (1992)_ (qv). It was until his film, _Geronimo: An American Legend (1993)_ (qv), was expected to be a big success that he decided to drop out of university completely.  Arriving in Hollywood, Matt managed to get his first break with a part in the romantic comedy, _Mystic Pizza (1988)_ (qv). However, the film did not do too well and his film career failed to take off. Not letting failure discourage him from acting, he went for another audition, and managed to get a starring role in _School Ties (1992)_ (qv).  Up next for Matt was a role as a soldier who had problems with drug-addiction in the movie, _Courage Under Fire (1996)_ (qv). Matt had, in fact, lost forty pounds for his role which resulted in health problems. The following year, he garnered accolades for _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), a screenplay he had originally written for an English class at Harvard University. _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv) was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, one of which, Matt won for Best Original Screenplay along with 'Ben Affleck' (qv).  In the year 1998, Matt played the title role in 'Steven Spielberg' (qv)'s film, _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv), which was one of the most acclaimed films in that year. Matt had the opportunity of working with 'Tom Hanks' (qv) and 'Vin Diesel' (qv) while filming that movie. That same year, he starred as an earnest law student and reformed poker player in _Rounders (1998)_ (qv), starring opposite 'Edward Norton (I)' (qv) and 'John Malkovich' (qv).  The next year, Matt rejoined his childhood friend, 'Ben Affleck' (qv) and fellow comedian, 'Chris Rock (I)' (qv), in the comedy _Dogma (1999)_ (qv). Towards the end of 1999, Matt played "Tom Ripley", a working-class young man who tastes the good life and will do anything to live it. Both 'Jude Law' (qv) and 'Gwyneth Paltrow' (qv) also starred in the movie. _The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)_ (qv) earned mixed reviews from critics, but even so, Matt earned praise for his performance.  Matt lent his voice to the animated movie, _Titan A.E. (2000)_ (qv) in the year 2000, which also earned mixed reviews from the public. He also starred in two other movies, _All the Pretty Horses (2000)_ (qv) and the golf comedy-drama, _The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)_ (qv), starring alongside 'Will Smith (I)' (qv).  In the year 2003, he signed on to star in _The Informant! (2009)_ (qv) by 'Steven Soderbergh' (qv) and the Farrelly Brothers' _Stuck on You (2003)_ (qv). He also starred in _Gerry (2002)_ (qv), a film he co-wrote with his friends, 'Gus Van Sant' (qv) and 'Casey Affleck' (qv).  One of Matt's most recognizable work to date is his role in the "Bourne" movie franchise. He plays an amnesiac assassin, "Jason Bourne", in _The Bourne Identity (2002)_ (qv), _The Bourne Supremacy (2004)_ (qv) and _The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)_ (qv).  Another praised role is that as "Linus Caldwell" in the "Ocean's" movie franchise. He had the opportunity to star opposite 'George Clooney' (qv), 'Brad Pitt' (qv), 'Julia Roberts (I)' (qv) and 'Don Cheadle' (qv) in _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv). The successful crime comedy-drama eventually had two other sequels, _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv) and _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv).  Among other highly acclaimed movies that Matt managed to be a part of was in 'Terry Gilliam' (qv)'s _The Brothers Grimm (2005)_ (qv), 'George Clooney' (qv)'s _Syriana (2005)_ (qv), 'Martin Scorsese' (qv)'s _The Departed (2006)_ (qv) and 'Robert De Niro' (qv)'s _The Good Shepherd (2006)_ (qv).  In his personal life, Matt is now happily married to Argentine-born 'Luciana Barroso' (qv), whom he met in Miami, where she was working as a bartender. They married in a private civil ceremony on December 9, 2005, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. The couple have four daughters Alexia, Luciana's daughter from a previous relationship, as well as Isabella, Gia and Stella.  Matt is a big fan of the Boston Red Sox and he tries to attend their games whenever possible. He has also formed great friendships with his Ocean's co-stars, 'George Clooney' (qv) and 'Brad Pitt' (qv), whom he works on charity projects with. He and actor 'Ben Affleck' (qv), together with Ben's wife, 'Jennifer Garner (I)' (qv), are also good family friends and can be often seen going out together with Matt's wife, 'Luciana Barroso' (qv).</biographie>

          <texte>Un de mes films préférés. "Ocean's Eleven", c'est d'abord un casting comme on en voit rarement au cinéma, c'est aussi une intrigue qui tient en haleine pendant tout le film et une réalisation impeccable de Steven Soderbergh. On ne s'ennuie pas une seule seconde, ce film est une perle, une oeuvre comme on en voit rarement au cinéma. Il y a aussi la musique qui colle parfaitement au cadre pendant tout le long du film. Je conseil vraiment ce film, que ce soit aux amateurs ou aux vrais cinéphiles. "Ocean's Eleven" est un film avec, un scénario parfait, qui est très drôle et très rafraîchissant, un film que l'on peut regarder à n'importe quel moment de la journée, que ce soit le soir ou en plein après-midi. Franchement, c'est un film qu'il faut voir au moins une fois.</texte>

      <synopsis>1986 - Soviet Russia has been arming international terrorists with chemical weapon technology, and a chemical weapons plant in the mountains is the target of James Bond and his closest compatriot, Alec Trevelyan. Infiltrating the compound, they are spotted and Alec is captured. When a ruthless Soviet officer, Oromov, executes Trevelyan, James pulls off a spectacular escape and succeeds in blowing up the compound. Now in 1995, he is assigned to tail former Red Air Force jet jockey Xenia Onatopp, who is working for a Russian crime syndicate known as Janus, but he is unable to stop her from stealing a powerful helicopter - a theft initially dismissed as a possibility by MI6's new leader, a woman who is a bureaucratic bean counter who, despite her acidic responses to grumbling from her ticked-off men, is having to learn her job as she goes, and who has to trust James Bond's instincts after a nuclear accident occurs over a Russian region housing the tracking station for a weapons satellite known as Goldeneye. James must track down the stolen gunship and all leads to a second Goldeneye system, and along the way he is horrified to find the true identity of the Janus syndicate, which leads to a spectacular running pursuit from the stolen gunship through a Soviet army prison to a wild street chase involving a tank and confrontation with a Soviet missile train, and eventually a showdown in the jungles of Cuba.</synopsis>

            <biographie>Sean Bean, England's most versatile actor, holds a stellar career spanning every medium for approximately 20 years, in theater, radio, television and movies. This soulful, green-eyed blonde's roles are so varied that his magnetic persona convincing plays angst-ridden villians, as in "Clarissa," passionate lovers like Mellors in "Lady Chatterley's Lover," rough-and-ready soldiers such as Richard Sharpe, heartwrenching warriors as the emotionally torn Boromir in "The Lord of the Rings," and noble Greeks, like Odysseus in "Troy," where his very presence in the film adds grace and validity to the rest of the movie.  Recently, he did a turn in Shakespeare's "Macbeth," where as the principal lead, he so transfixed the audience that the show was extended in London and critically acclaimed.  Bean, however, remains himself, a man's man, and in the glizty world of movies this is a rare thing indeed. Bean currently resides in London where he enjoys raising his beautiful daughters, his beloved football, and the occasional pint. In his home country of England, he was recently voted the second sexiest man in the UK, and seemed to enjoy this notoriety, stating, "I don't have any problems with women seeing me as their ideal bit of 'rough'. Why would I?" Well, good to know, because his legions of fans do not have a problem with it either.</biographie>

            <biographie>Robbie Coltrane, one of Britain's most popular comedians who was head of debating society at school and won prizes for his art, is now a film star who played in two James Bond films and in the "Harry Potter" franchise.  He was born Anthony Robert McMillan on March 30, 1950, in Rutherglen, a suburb of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. His father, Ian McMillan, was a general surgeon who also worked for police pathology. His mother, Jean, was a teacher and a pianist. Young Robbie was fond of art, music, films and cars. He was a voracious reader of his dad's books on medicine and crime. At age 12 he made his acting debut on stage at Glenalmond College, delivering rants from "Henry V". At that time he was fascinated with 'Marlon Brando' (qv) and 'Orson Welles' (qv).  He attended Glasgow Art School, majoring in drawing, painting and film, then studied art at Edinburgh's Moray House College of Education for a year. In 1973 he made a documentary titled "Young Mental Health", which was voted Film Of The Year by the Scottish Education Council. At that time Robbie took the name Coltrane, due to his love of jazz, and began a career of a stand-up comedian at night clubs, at the Edinburgh Festival, as well as an actor with Edinburgh's renowned Traverse Theatre.  In 1980 Coltrane made his debut on television as "Border Guard" in BBC's mini-series _"The Lost Tribe" (1980)_ (qv), then made his big screen debut as a limousine driver in _La mort en direct (1980)_ (qv). In 1981 he appeared in his first leading role as Detective Fritz Langley in _Subway Riders (1981)_ (qv), by famed underground director 'Amos Poe' (qv).  He became a well-known face through appearances in The Comic Strip series, then in _"Alfresco" (1983)_ (qv) and Comic Strip movies _The Supergrass (1985)_ (qv) and _The Pope Must Die (1991)_ (qv), among other films. At that time Coltrane had a drinking problem, downing as much as a bottle of whiskey a day. In 1986 he flew to a clinic in Mexico and was treated for obesity. In 1987 his partner for 15 years, Robin Paine, left him for good, leaving her portrait in Coltrane's barn.  In 1988 Coltrane met then 18-year-old Rhona Gemmell in a pub. They married and had a son, Spencer, and a daughter, Alice. His career took off during the early 1990s with the leading role as Dr. Eddie "Fitz" Fitzgerald, a forensic psychologist, in the popular TV series _"Cracker" (1993)_ (qv).  He made such a good performance as Valentin Zukovsky, a KGB man turned St. Petersburg mafia lord, in _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) the producers called him back for the same character in _The World Is Not Enough (1999)_ (qv). Then Coltrane hit another lucrative franchise; he was personally selected by 'J.K. Rowling' (qv) as her choice to play half-giant Rubeus Hagrid in the 'Harry Potter' films.  In early 1990s Coltrane wrote an autobiography, "Coltrane in a Cadillac", and also starred in the eponymous TV series, _"Coltrane in a Cadillac" (1993)_ (qv), in which he indulges his passion for vintage cars and tells with great humor about his 4000-mile journey across America from Los Angeles to New York. In 2003 he separated from his wife. His interests outside of his acting profession has been reading books, and rebuilding and collecting vintage cars. Robbie Coltrane resides in a converted farmhouse in Stirlingshire, Scotland, UK.</biographie>

            <biographie>Alan Cumming was born on January 27, 1965, in Aberfeldy, Scotland. His family lived nearby in Dunkeld, where his father, Alex, was a forester for Atholl Estate. The family (Alex, mother Mary, big brother Tom and Alan) moved to Fassfern near Fort William soon after, before moving to the east coast of Scotland in 1969 where Alan's dad took up the position of Head Forester of Panmure Estate, and it was here Alan grew up. He went to Monikie Primary School and Carnoustie High School, where he began appearing in plays, and soon after that began working with with the Carnoustie Theatre Club and Carnoustie Musical Society. In 1981 he left high school with 8 'O' Grades and 4 Highers, but because he was too young to enter any university or drama school he worked for just over a year as a sub-editor at D.C. Thomson Publishers in Dundee. There he worked on the launch of a new magazine, "Tops", and was also the "Young Alan" who answered readers' letters. In September 1982 he began a three-year course at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow. He graduated in 1985 with a B.A. (Dramatic Studies) and awards for verse speaking and direction. He also had formed a cabaret double act with fellow student 'Forbes Masson' (qv) called Victor and Barry, which went on to become hugely successful with tours (including two Perrier Pick of the Fringe seasons in London and a month-long engagement at the Sydney Opera House as part of an Australian tour), records ("Hear Victor and Barry and Faint", "Are We Too Loud?") and many TV appearances throughout the UK. Before graduating Alan made his professional theater and film debuts in "Macbeth" at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow and in 'Gillies MacKinnon' (qv)'s "Passing Glory". After graduating Alan worked extensively in Scottish theater and television, including a stint on the soap opera _"Take the High Road" (1980)_ (qv) before moving to London when "Conquest of the South Pole", a play by German playwright 'Manfred Karge' (qv), transferred from the Traverse Theatre in, Edinburgh to the the Royal Court in London, earning him his first Olivier award nomination for Most Promising Newcomer of 1988.  Alan performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company and then the Royal National Theatre, where he starred in "Accidental Death of an Anarchist", which he also adapted with director 'Tim Supple' (qv). The production was nominated for Best revival at the 1991 Olivier awards and Alan won for Comedy Performance of the Year. Then his film career began with 'Ian Sellar (I)' (qv)'s _Prague (1992)_ (qv), in which he starred with 'Sandrine Bonnaire' (qv) and 'Bruno Ganz' (qv). The film premiered at the 1992 Cannes film festival and went on to win him Best Actor award at the Atlantic Film Festival and a Scottish BAFTA Best Actor nomination. In the same year he made two films for the BBC - _"Screen Two" (1985) {The Last Romantics (#8.11)}_ (qv) and _Bernard and the Genie (1991) (TV)_ (qv), the latter winning him the Top Television Newcomer award at 1992 British Comedy Awards. In the 1992 Olivier awards he was also nominated for Comedy Performance of the Year for "La Bete". In 1993 he played Hamlet for the English Touring Theare to great critical acclaim ("An actor knocking on the door of greatness" - Daily Mail; ranked first and second--with his performance in "Cabaret"--in the Daily Telegraph's performances of the year) and then immediately went on to play the Emcee in 'Sam Mendes (I)' (qv)' revival of "Cabaret" at the same venue (London's Donmar Warehouse). He received a 1994 Olivier award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical for "Cabaret", and for Hamlet he received the 1994 TMA Best Actor award and a Shakespeare Globe award nomination.  In 1994 he made his first Hollywood film, _Circle of Friends (1995)_ (qv), and his performance as the oleaginous Sean Walsh along with those in two films released in quick succession (_Emma (1996)_ (qv) and _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv)) brought him to the attention of American producers, and he appeared in several Hollywood films, such as _Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997)_ (qv) and _Buddy (1997)_ (qv). He returned to the UK in 1997 to work with 'Stanley Kubrick' (qv) and the 'Spice Girls' (qv) before returning stateside in 1998 to reprise his role in "Cabaret" on Broadway. The show and his portrayal were a sensation, and he received the Tony, Drama Desk, Outer Critics' Circle, Theatre World, FANY, New York Press and New York Public Advocate's awards for his performance. Since then he has alternated between theater and films, and also between smaller independent films and more mainstream fare. His theater work includes 2001's "Design for Living" on Broadway and the hugely successful off-Broadway "Elle" by 'Jean Genet' (qv), which he adapted and played the lead in 2002. Films have included 'Julie Taymor' (qv)'s _Titus (1999)_ (qv), _Urbania (2000)_ (qv), the "Spy Kids" trilogy, _Josie and the Pussycats (2001)_ (qv), _X2 (2003)_ (qv), _Nicholas Nickleby (2002)_ (qv), _Son of the Mask (2005)_ (qv) and the Showtime movie musical _Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical (2005) (TV)_ (qv). He wrote, directed, produced and acted in _The Anniversary Party (2001)_ (qv) with 'Jennifer Jason Leigh' (qv), which premiered at the Cannes Film festival in 2002 and went on to win a National Board of Review award and two Independent Spirit award nominations. More recently he has produced the documentary Show People (2004) and the films _Sweet Land (2005)_ (qv) and _Full Grown Men (2006)_ (qv) (and appears in both) and acted in _Gray Matters (2006/I)_ (qv) opposite 'Heather Graham (I)' (qv) and _Bam Bam and Celeste (2005)_ (qv) opposite 'Margaret Cho' (qv). in 2006 he will return to Broadway as Macheath in "The Threepenny Opera". He has also found the time to write a novel, "Tommy's Tale", in 2002 and a fragrance, "Cumming" in 2005.</biographie>

            <biographie>Tall, broad shouldered character actor with Texan drawl first appeared in support in several Western vehicles both on TV and the cinema in the mid 1960s. Got himself noticed playing Steve McQueen's younger brother in _Junior Bonner (1972)_ (qv), and then scored the lead role of Buford Pusser (!) in the unexpected hit _Walking Tall (1973)_ (qv), an allegedly true tale about a Southern sheriff confronting corruption &amp; gangsters with a large wooden club and a mean attitude. Followed it up by playing a sadistic hit man called Molly, in Don Siegel's bank heist drama _Charley Varrick (1973)_ (qv). Joe Don Baker's next few films were rather forgettable until he landed the role of police detective Earl Eischied in _To Kill a Cop (1978) (TV)_ (qv)....which led him into reprising the same character in the short lived TV series _"Eischied" (1979)_ (qv). Since then he has proved he is also quite adept at taking on comedy roles, as well as picking up plenty of work playing lawmen, military men, politicians etc. Keep your eye open for him as a nosy police chief in _Fletch (1985)_ (qv), a meglomanical general in _The Living Daylights (1987)_ (qv), as a redneck father in _Mars Attacks! (1996)_ (qv), and as intelligence operative Jack Wade in the 007 films _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv) and _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv).</biographie>

            <biographie>Pierce Brosnan was born in Navan, County Meath, Ireland, and lived in Navan, County Meath, until he moved to England, UK, at an early age (thus explaining his ability to play men from both backgrounds convincingly). His father left the household when Pierce was a child and although reunited later in life, the two have never had a close relationship. His most popular role is that of British secret agent James Bond. The death, in 1991, of 'Cassandra Harris (I)' (qv), his wife of eleven years, left him with three children - Christopher and Charlotte from Cassandra's first marriage and Sean from their marriage. Since her death, he has had two children with his second wife, 'Keely Shaye Smith' (qv).</biographie>

            <biographie>Desmond Llewelyn was born in South Wales in 1914, the son of a coal mining engineer. In high school, he worked as a stagehand in the school's productions and then picked up sporadic small parts. His family would not give up their effort to prevent him from a life on stage, so an uncle who was a high ranking police officer arranged for Llewelyn to take the department's physical exam. "Thank God, I flunked the eye test, and they wouldn't take me. I suspect the inspector had a hangover because he also failed this other chap I knew, who went out the same day and passed the physical for the Royal Navy, which had a lot tougher test." After failing the police exam, Llewelyn thought about becoming a minister, realizing after a week-long retreat of quiet and meditation that the ministry "was definitely not for me." Llewelyn persevered in his acting quest, and was accepted to the Royal Academy for the Dramatic Arts in the mid 1930s. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939, halted his acting career, and Llewelyn was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British army. He was assigned to the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and was sent to France in early 1940. In a short time, his regiment was fighting the Germans, and Llewelyn's company was holding off a division of German tanks. Llewelyn explained that "eventually, the tanks broke through and many of us jumped into this canal and started swimming down it to the other side, figuring that our chaps were still over there. But the Germans were the only ones there," and Llewelyn was captured, and held as a prisoner of war for five years. At one prison camp, the prisoners had dug a tunnel and were planning to escape the next morning. Llewelyn was down in the tunnel doing some maintenance work in preparation of the escape when the Germans found out about the tunnel and caught him down in it, a crime that earned Llewelyn 10 days in solitary, which Llewelyn called "a blessing of sorts. After spending every day of several years sleeping in a room with 50 other people, the quiet and privacy was rather nice." After the war, Llewelyn returned to London and revived his career, eventually being cast as his trademark Q in _From Russia with Love (1963)_ (qv). Since 1963, Llewelyn has appeared as Q in every Eon Productions Bond film, except _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Llewelyn was omitted from _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) because producers 'Harry Saltzman' (qv) and 'Albert R. Broccoli' (qv) felt that too much was being made of the gadgets and they would play it down. Llewelyn said he "was quite disappointed" at being left out of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Fans, however, missed Q, and Llewelyn got a call shortly after the release of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) telling him that he would be in the next Bond film, _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv). Llewelyn, who admits that his mechanical abilities in real life are virtually nil, is geared up for the next Bond movie. "I'd love to be in the next one," Llewelyn said. "Of course, if you consider my age, they should have put me out to grass a long time ago."</biographie>

When they get together they deduce that Benedict wants them to pay him back what they took with interest. Knowing they can't do a job in the U.S. they decide to go to Europe. Danny's number 2 Rusty decides to go to Amsterdam cause there's a guy there who can give them jobs but Rusty doesn't tell them that he has another reason for wanting to go there. When they try to pull the job they were given, they discover that someone else has pulled the job. They deduce he was the one who told Benedict who they are. Later Europol operative Isabel Lahiri investigates and upon seeing how they tried to do it, shows up at their door. It seems she and Rusty "know" each other, and he's been following her. While she chooses not to arrest them, she warns them not to do anything. She also tells them who the man is who told Benedict. When they find him, they learn that he feels offended that his mentor who is a great thief thinks they're better than him so he challenges them to steal something and if they do he'll give them the money they need to pay Benedict.

            <biographie>Matthew Paige Damon, or better known to fans as Matt Damon was born in Boston Massachusetts, USA to 'Kent Damon' (qv), a stockbroker, Realtor and tax preparer, and 'Nancy Carlsson-Paige' (qv), an early childhood education professor at Lesley University. Matt has an older brother named Kyle who is now a sculptor. Unfortunately for Matt and his brother, their parents divorced in the year 1973.  The 5'10" star is of English, Scottish, Finnish, and Swedish ancestry. While his parents were still together, their family lived in Newton, before eventually settling for a divorce, where Damon and his brother moved with his mother to Cambridge. He grew up in a stable community back in Massachusetts. Matt also grew up near actor 'Ben Affleck' (qv), when he was younger.  Matt attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School which is located in Cambridge and he performed in a number of theater productions during his time there. Later on, he was accepted into Harvard University as an English major in the fall of 1988 and was supposed to graduate with the class of 1992. While in Harvard, he kept on skipping classes to pursue acting projects, which included the TNT original film, _Rising Sun (1993)_ (qv), and prep-school drama, _School Ties (1992)_ (qv). It was until his film, _Geronimo: An American Legend (1993)_ (qv), was expected to be a big success that he decided to drop out of university completely.  Arriving in Hollywood, Matt managed to get his first break with a part in the romantic comedy, _Mystic Pizza (1988)_ (qv). However, the film did not do too well and his film career failed to take off. Not letting failure discourage him from acting, he went for another audition, and managed to get a starring role in _School Ties (1992)_ (qv).  Up next for Matt was a role as a soldier who had problems with drug-addiction in the movie, _Courage Under Fire (1996)_ (qv). Matt had, in fact, lost forty pounds for his role which resulted in health problems. The following year, he garnered accolades for _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), a screenplay he had originally written for an English class at Harvard University. _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv) was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, one of which, Matt won for Best Original Screenplay along with 'Ben Affleck' (qv).  In the year 1998, Matt played the title role in 'Steven Spielberg' (qv)'s film, _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv), which was one of the most acclaimed films in that year. Matt had the opportunity of working with 'Tom Hanks' (qv) and 'Vin Diesel' (qv) while filming that movie. That same year, he starred as an earnest law student and reformed poker player in _Rounders (1998)_ (qv), starring opposite 'Edward Norton (I)' (qv) and 'John Malkovich' (qv).  The next year, Matt rejoined his childhood friend, 'Ben Affleck' (qv) and fellow comedian, 'Chris Rock (I)' (qv), in the comedy _Dogma (1999)_ (qv). Towards the end of 1999, Matt played "Tom Ripley", a working-class young man who tastes the good life and will do anything to live it. Both 'Jude Law' (qv) and 'Gwyneth Paltrow' (qv) also starred in the movie. _The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)_ (qv) earned mixed reviews from critics, but even so, Matt earned praise for his performance.  Matt lent his voice to the animated movie, _Titan A.E. (2000)_ (qv) in the year 2000, which also earned mixed reviews from the public. He also starred in two other movies, _All the Pretty Horses (2000)_ (qv) and the golf comedy-drama, _The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)_ (qv), starring alongside 'Will Smith (I)' (qv).  In the year 2003, he signed on to star in _The Informant! (2009)_ (qv) by 'Steven Soderbergh' (qv) and the Farrelly Brothers' _Stuck on You (2003)_ (qv). He also starred in _Gerry (2002)_ (qv), a film he co-wrote with his friends, 'Gus Van Sant' (qv) and 'Casey Affleck' (qv).  One of Matt's most recognizable work to date is his role in the "Bourne" movie franchise. He plays an amnesiac assassin, "Jason Bourne", in _The Bourne Identity (2002)_ (qv), _The Bourne Supremacy (2004)_ (qv) and _The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)_ (qv).  Another praised role is that as "Linus Caldwell" in the "Ocean's" movie franchise. He had the opportunity to star opposite 'George Clooney' (qv), 'Brad Pitt' (qv), 'Julia Roberts (I)' (qv) and 'Don Cheadle' (qv) in _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv). The successful crime comedy-drama eventually had two other sequels, _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv) and _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv).  Among other highly acclaimed movies that Matt managed to be a part of was in 'Terry Gilliam' (qv)'s _The Brothers Grimm (2005)_ (qv), 'George Clooney' (qv)'s _Syriana (2005)_ (qv), 'Martin Scorsese' (qv)'s _The Departed (2006)_ (qv) and 'Robert De Niro' (qv)'s _The Good Shepherd (2006)_ (qv).  In his personal life, Matt is now happily married to Argentine-born 'Luciana Barroso' (qv), whom he met in Miami, where she was working as a bartender. They married in a private civil ceremony on December 9, 2005, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. The couple have four daughters Alexia, Luciana's daughter from a previous relationship, as well as Isabella, Gia and Stella.  Matt is a big fan of the Boston Red Sox and he tries to attend their games whenever possible. He has also formed great friendships with his Ocean's co-stars, 'George Clooney' (qv) and 'Brad Pitt' (qv), whom he works on charity projects with. He and actor 'Ben Affleck' (qv), together with Ben's wife, 'Jennifer Garner (I)' (qv), are also good family friends and can be often seen going out together with Matt's wife, 'Luciana Barroso' (qv).</biographie>

            <biographie>Julia Fiona Roberts, born in Smyrna, Georgia, never dreamed she would become the most popular actress in America. As a child, due to her love of animals, Julia originally wanted to be a veterinarian, but later studied journalism. When her brother, 'Eric Roberts (I)' (qv), achieved some success in Hollywood, Julia decided to try acting. Her first break came in 1988 when she appeared in two youth-oriented movies _Mystic Pizza (1988)_ (qv) and _Satisfaction (1988)_ (qv). The movies introduced her to a new audience who instantly fell in love with this pretty woman. Julia's biggest success was in the signature movie _Pretty Woman (1990)_ (qv), for which Julia got an Oscar nomination, and also won the People's Choice award for Favorite Actress. Even though Julia would spend the next few years either starring in serious movies, or playing fantasy roles like Tinkerbell, the movie audiences would always love Julia best in romantic comedies. With _My Best Friend's Wedding (1997)_ (qv) Julia gave the genre fresh life that had been lacking in Hollywood for some time. Offscreen, after a brief marriage, Julia has been romantically linked with several other actors. Julia has also become involved with UNICEF charities and has made visits to many different countries, including Haiti and India, in order to promote goodwill. Julia is one of the most popular and sought-after talents in Hollywood.</biographie>

            <biographie>Bernard Jeffrey McCollough was born in Chicago in 1957. He grew up in Chicago, in a rougher neighborhood than most others, with a large family living under one roof. This situation provided him with a great insight into his comedy, as his family, and the situations surrounding them would be what dominated his comedy. Mac worked in the Regal Theater, and performed in Chicago parks in his younger days. He became a professional comedian in 1977, at the age of 19. He refused to change his image for television and films, and therefore was not very well known for most of the eighties. In 1992 he made his film debut with a small part with _Mo' Money (1992)_ (qv). This started a plethora of small parts in a string of movies, mostly comedies, including _Who's the Man? (1993)_ (qv), _House Party 3 (1994)_ (qv) and _The Walking Dead (1995)_ (qv). 1995 proved to be a turning point in his career. He did an HBO Special called _"Midnight Mac" (1995)_ (qv), and took a part as Pastor Clever in the Chris Tucker comedy _Friday (1995)_ (qv). Bernie Mac developed a cult following due to the movie and had many small parts since. In 1996 he starred in the memorable 'Spike Lee' (qv) movie _Get on the Bus (1996)_ (qv), and was very funny in _Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996)_ (qv). About this time he had a recurring role in the TV series _"Moesha" (1996)_ (qv). Bernie Mac's star was slowly rising from this point. His next couple of movie parts were more substantial, including _How to Be a Player (1997)_ (qv) and _The Players Club (1998)_ (qv). In 1999 Bernie Mac got his most high profile part up to that point in the film _Life (1999/I)_ (qv) starring 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv).  The new century started a new era for the brash Chicago comedian. He was a featured comedian in _The Original Kings of Comedy (2000)_ (qv). This performance made him more of a household name, and led to many more major parts. In 2001 he played Martin Lawrence's uncle in _What's the Worst That Could Happen? (2001)_ (qv) and later that year, was in the star studded remake of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv). However his biggest success was _"The Bernie Mac Show" (2001)_ (qv), which debuted in 2001 to instant acclaim. However, soon after the series ended, Mac's health took a turn for the worse. He developed sarcoidosis, an autoimmune disease which causes inflammation in the lungs. On August 9, 2008, after weeks of unsuccessful treatments, Bernie Mac died at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was 50.  Bernie Mac was a comedian that refused to change his image for Hollywood and said that his life in Chicago was who he was and there was nothing that could change that. He was a mature comedian who was very intelligent and very engaging in his TV, movie and stand-up appearances.</biographie>

            <biographie>Catherine Zeta-Jones was born on September 25, 1969 in Swansea, West Glamorgan, Wales, UK, the daughter of Dai Jones, who formerly owned a candy factory, and Pat Jones. Her brother David Jones (b. 1967) is a development executive and brother Lyndon Jones (b. 1972) works at her production company. Catherine showed an interest early on in entertainment. She starred on stage in "Annie", "Bugsy Malone" and "The Pajama Game". At age 15, she had the lead in the British revival of "42nd Street". She was originally cast as the second understudy for the lead role in the musical but when the star and first understudy became sick the night the play's producer was in the audience, she was given the lead for the rest of the musical's production. She first made a name for herself in the early 1990s when she starred in the Yorkshire Television comedy/drama series _"The Darling Buds of May" (1991)_ (qv). The series was a smash hit and made her one of the United Kingdom's most popular television actresses. She subsequently played supporting roles in several films including _Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (1992)_ (qv), the miniseries _Catherine the Great (1996) (TV)_ (qv) and a larger part as the seductive Sala in _The Phantom (1996)_ (qv) before landing her breakthrough role playing the fiery Elena opposite 'Anthony Hopkins (I)' (qv) and 'Antonio Banderas' (qv) in _The Mask of Zorro (1998)_ (qv). She starred in many big-budget blockbusters like _Entrapment (1999)_ (qv), _The Haunting (1999)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv), for which many believed she was robbed of an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. In November 2000, she married actor 'Michael Douglas (I)' (qv). She gave birth to their son Dylan Michael in August 2000 followed by daughter, Carys, in April 2003. She was awarded Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2010 Queen's Birthday Honours List for her accomplishments in film and television.</biographie>

            <biographie>American actor Casey Affleck has an onscreen career dating back to 1988, but his Academy Award nominated work in _The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)_ (qv) gained him wider acclaim in recent years.  Affleck, the younger brother of 'Ben Affleck' (qv), was born Caleb Casey McGuire Affleck-Boldt on 12 August 1975 in Falmouth, Massachusetts to middle-class parents; his mother was a school district employee and teacher, and father was a drug counselor who also served as a social worker, auto mechanic, custodian and bartender. He was also part of the Theater Company of Boston.  Affleck appeared in various roles on television while finishing high school and attending university, including as young Robert Kennedy in the TV mini-series _"The Kennedys of Massachusetts" (1990)_ (qv). After graduating high school, he attended George Washington University and eventually transferred into Columbia University in New York, but he never earned his Bachelor's degree.  Affleck's first major film role was in 'Gus Van Sant' (qv)'s _To Die For (1995)_ (qv), in which he co-starred with his future brother-in-law 'Joaquin Phoenix' (qv) and 'Nicole Kidman' (qv). He would go on to appear in two films with his brother, _Chasing Amy (1997)_ (qv) and _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), which 'Ben Affleck' (qv) co-wrote with 'Matt Damon' (qv). Affleck then chose a variety of roles, most of which were considered to be commercial failures, including _Drowning Mona (2000)_ (qv), a modern version of _Hamlet (2000)_ (qv) and _Soul Survivors (2001)_ (qv). He also co-wrote the screenplay _Gerry (2002)_ (qv) with 'Gus Van Sant' (qv) and 'Matt Damon' (qv), which received a limited release in the United States.  But 2001 brought Affleck a plum role as part of Ocean's Eleven's ensemble cast. Affleck's character, a getaway driver named Virgil Malloy, reappeared in _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv) and _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv). Affleck also received positive critical notice for his work in _Gone Baby Gone (2007)_ (qv), and directed 'Joaquin Phoenix' (qv) in the "hoax-umentary" _I'm Still Here (2010/I)_ (qv). He also recently co-starred in the ensemble comedy _Tower Heist (2011)_ (qv).  Affleck has signed on to star in the independent movie _Ain't Them Bodies Saints (2013)_, described as a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-inspired tale about an escaped convict on the run through Texas, trying to reunite with his wife and daughter. He is married 'Summer Phoenix' (qv), to whom he was introduced by her brother Joaquin. The couple has two sons.</biographie>

            <biographie>Carl Reiner is a legend of American comedy, having achieved great success as a comic actor, a director, producer and recording artist. He has won nine Emmy Awards, three as an actor, three as a writer and two as a producer. He also won a Grammy Award for his "10,000 Year Old Man" album, based on his comedy routine with 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv).  Reiner was born in The Bronx. His father Irving, a Romanian immigrant, was a watchmaker; his mother, Bessie (née Mathias), had been born in Austria. At the age of 16, while working as a sewing machine repairman, he attended a dramatic workshop sponsored by the Works Progress Administration. The direction of his life was set.  In the 1970s, some sources claimed that Reiner made his movie debut in _New Faces of 1937 (1937)_ (qv), but that is unlikely as he would have only been 15-years-old at the time. (Interesting, that movie shares the same plot as his erstwhile partner 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv)' 1968 classic, _The Producers (1967)_ (qv), with a crooked producer planning to fleece his "angels" by producing a flop and absconding with the money). He didn't appear on screen, silver or small, until he made his TV debut in 1948 in the short-lived TV series, _"The Fashion Story" (1948)_ (qv), then became a regular, the following year, on _"The Fifty-Fourth Street Revue" (1949), another TV series with a brief life.  Reiner made his Broadway debut in 1949 in the musical "Inside U.S.A.", a hit that ran for 399 performances. His next Broadway show, the 1950 musical revue, "Alive and Kicking", was a flop, lasting just 43 performances. 'Max Liebman' (qv), the producer/director/writer/composer, had been called in to provide additional material after the show's troubled six week out-of-town preview in Boston. It didn't help -- the show closed after six weeks on Broadway -- but an important contact had been made.  Leibman was a producer-director on _"Your Show of Shows" (1950)_ (qv), one of the great TV series, and he hired Reiner to appear on the show in the middle of its first season. Reiner's first gig on the revue-like show was interviewing "The Professor", a character played by 'Sid Caesar' (qv). He became central to the comedy portions of the show and, in 1953, he racked up the first of six Emmy nominations for acting. (In all, he was nominated for an Emmy Award a total of 13 times). When, in 1954, "Your Show of Shows" was split up by the network into its constituent parts, Reiner continued on with Sid in _"Caesar's Hour" (1954)_ (qv). ('Imogene Coca' (qv) was given her own show, which lasted one season, and Leibman was allowed to produced specials).  "Your Show or Shows" had been a Broadway-style revue, featuring skits such as dancing (including a young 'Bob Fosse' (qv)) whereas "Caesar's Hour" was pure comedy. "Your Show of Shows" had had a great cast, another other than Coca, most of the cast, including Reiner, 'Howard Morris (I)' (qv), and 'Nanette Fabray' (qv) (who went on to win an Emmy) moved over to "Caesar's Hour". In his three seasons on the show, he was nominated three more times for a Best Supporting Actor Emmy, winning twice in 1957 and 1958. But it was its stable of comedy writers that was essential to the great success of both "Your Show of Shows" and "Caesar's Hour". In addition to 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv), the writing staff included 'Neil Simon (I)' (qv), his brother 'Danny Simon (I)' (qv), 'Larry Gelbart' (qv) and 'Mel Tolkin' (qv). (There are rumors that the young 'Woody Allen' (qv) served as the writing staff's typist).  Reiner had sat in informally with the writers during "Your Show of Shows", but he began writing formally for "Caesar's Hour", having learned his craft from all of the other writers. As a self-described uncredited "writer without portfolio", he was able to leave writers' meetings at 6 PM, if he wanted to. This gave him the time to work on a semi-autobiographical novel. Published in 1958, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv) is about a young man in 1930s New York trying to make it in show business. It was transformed into a play and, eventually, adapted into a movie in 1967, and a musical, many years later.  In 1959, he created the pilot for a TV series, "Man of the House", in which he would play a writer, "Rob Petrie", who balanced his family life with the demands of working as a writer for a comedy show headlined by an egotistical comedic genius modeled after 'Sid Caesar' (qv) (a "benign despot" who lacked social skills, according to Reiner). The series was rooted in his experience on "Your Show of Shows" and "Caesar's Hour". The network didn't pick up the pilot at first, as CBS executives claimed the main character, which was clearly autobiographical on Reiner's part, was too New York, too Jewish and too intellectual. In 1960, Reiner teamed up with 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv) on _"The Steve Allen Show" (1956)_ (qv), and their routine "The 2000 Year Old Man" was a huge success. Reiner played the straight man to Brooks in the routine, which was spun-off into five comedy albums, bringing them a Grammy Award. They also made an animated TV special based on their shtick in 1975.  Though CBS turned down "Man of the House", with the two-time Emmy-winning comedian Reiner as the lead, it was still interested in the series. However, they wanted a WASP in the role of "Rob Petrie" to ensure the broad appeal of the show, and the casting of the protagonist came down to 'Johnny Carson (I)' (qv) and 'Dick Van Dyke' (qv). Carson was a game show host of no great note at the time, but Van Dyke was in the smash Broadway musical, _Bye Bye Birdie (1963)_ (qv), for which he won a Tony Award. He got the part and another chapter of TV history was made, when 'Mary Tyler Moore' (qv), 'Rose Marie (I)' (qv) and 'Morey Amsterdam' (qv) all were cast in leading roles. Reiner, himself, would eventually play the role of "Alan Brady", the abrasive 'Sid Caesar' (qv)-like comic convinced of his own genius, in the last few seasons of the series' five-year run.  Another milestone in TV comedy, _"The Dick Van Dyke Show" (1961)_ (qv), brought Reiner five more Emmies, three for writing and two as the producer of the series. In 1966, Reiner and the other principals, including executive producer 'Sheldon Leonard' (qv) and Dick Van Dyke, decided to end the series at the height of its popularity and critical acclaim. (The show won Emmies as best show and best comedy in 1965 and 1966, respectively). Twenty-nine years after the show was ended, Reiner reprised the role of "Alan Brady" on _"Mad About You" (1992)_ (qv), winning his eighth (and so far, last) Emmy Award, this time as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.  It was on "The Dick Van Dyke Show" that Reiner first became a director. His feature film debut, as a director, was with the film adaptation of the play 'Joseph Stein' (qv) had adapted from his 1958 novel, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv). His work as a writer-director, with 'Dick Van Dyke' (qv), in creating a 'Stan Laurel' (qv)-type character in _The Comic (1969)_ (qv) was not a success, but _Where's Poppa? (1970)_ (qv) became a cult classic and _Oh, God! (1977)_ (qv), with 'George Burns (I)' (qv), and _The Jerk (1979)_ (qv), with 'Steve Martin (I)' (qv), were smash hits. The last movie he directed was the 1997 comedy, _That Old Feeling (1997)_ (qv).  Reiner's career has continued on into the 21st Century, when most of his contemporaries had retired. He was awarded the 'Mark Twain' (qv) Prize for American Humor in 2000 and, starting in 2001, he acted in the remake of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) and its two sequels. Most recently, he has appeared as a voice artist in the animated series, _"The Cleveland Show" (2009)_ (qv) (he even wrote an episode for the series rooted in his "Your Show of Shows" experience) and has appeared as a regular on the TV series, _"Hot in Cleveland" (2010)_ (qv) (with fellow nonagenarian 'Betty White (I)' (qv)), as well as appeared on an episode of _"Parks and Recreation" (2009)_ (qv) in 2012.</biographie>

            <biographie>Robbie Coltrane, one of Britain's most popular comedians who was head of debating society at school and won prizes for his art, is now a film star who played in two James Bond films and in the "Harry Potter" franchise.  He was born Anthony Robert McMillan on March 30, 1950, in Rutherglen, a suburb of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. His father, Ian McMillan, was a general surgeon who also worked for police pathology. His mother, Jean, was a teacher and a pianist. Young Robbie was fond of art, music, films and cars. He was a voracious reader of his dad's books on medicine and crime. At age 12 he made his acting debut on stage at Glenalmond College, delivering rants from "Henry V". At that time he was fascinated with 'Marlon Brando' (qv) and 'Orson Welles' (qv).  He attended Glasgow Art School, majoring in drawing, painting and film, then studied art at Edinburgh's Moray House College of Education for a year. In 1973 he made a documentary titled "Young Mental Health", which was voted Film Of The Year by the Scottish Education Council. At that time Robbie took the name Coltrane, due to his love of jazz, and began a career of a stand-up comedian at night clubs, at the Edinburgh Festival, as well as an actor with Edinburgh's renowned Traverse Theatre.  In 1980 Coltrane made his debut on television as "Border Guard" in BBC's mini-series _"The Lost Tribe" (1980)_ (qv), then made his big screen debut as a limousine driver in _La mort en direct (1980)_ (qv). In 1981 he appeared in his first leading role as Detective Fritz Langley in _Subway Riders (1981)_ (qv), by famed underground director 'Amos Poe' (qv).  He became a well-known face through appearances in The Comic Strip series, then in _"Alfresco" (1983)_ (qv) and Comic Strip movies _The Supergrass (1985)_ (qv) and _The Pope Must Die (1991)_ (qv), among other films. At that time Coltrane had a drinking problem, downing as much as a bottle of whiskey a day. In 1986 he flew to a clinic in Mexico and was treated for obesity. In 1987 his partner for 15 years, Robin Paine, left him for good, leaving her portrait in Coltrane's barn.  In 1988 Coltrane met then 18-year-old Rhona Gemmell in a pub. They married and had a son, Spencer, and a daughter, Alice. His career took off during the early 1990s with the leading role as Dr. Eddie "Fitz" Fitzgerald, a forensic psychologist, in the popular TV series _"Cracker" (1993)_ (qv).  He made such a good performance as Valentin Zukovsky, a KGB man turned St. Petersburg mafia lord, in _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) the producers called him back for the same character in _The World Is Not Enough (1999)_ (qv). Then Coltrane hit another lucrative franchise; he was personally selected by 'J.K. Rowling' (qv) as her choice to play half-giant Rubeus Hagrid in the 'Harry Potter' films.  In early 1990s Coltrane wrote an autobiography, "Coltrane in a Cadillac", and also starred in the eponymous TV series, _"Coltrane in a Cadillac" (1993)_ (qv), in which he indulges his passion for vintage cars and tells with great humor about his 4000-mile journey across America from Los Angeles to New York. In 2003 he separated from his wife. His interests outside of his acting profession has been reading books, and rebuilding and collecting vintage cars. Robbie Coltrane resides in a converted farmhouse in Stirlingshire, Scotland, UK.</biographie>

            <biographie>Muscular, swaggering and tough, Scott Caan gives every indication of becoming a "man's-man" like his father, legendary actor 'James Caan (I)' (qv). While it is obvious that he admires tough method actors like 'Marlon Brando' (qv) and 'Sean Penn (I)' (qv), Scott also has a strong egalitarian streak, evidenced by his reasoning for baring his body in films. He is quoted as saying that originally only the women in the scene were to be nude, but that he felt it really sexist, so he stripped too.  Scott was born on August 23, 1976 in Los Angeles, California. He spent his childhood being shuttled between his parent's homes. His mom is actress and model 'Sheila Ryan (II)' (qv); the Caans divorced when Scott was a year old. He has an older half-sister, Tara, and three younger half-brothers: Alexander, Jacob, and James.  Self-desribed as a bad kid who was always getting into trouble, Scott initially steered clear of acting, opting to play sports instead. Scott benefited from his father's hands-on approach to child rearing; the elder Caan reportedly took a five-year hiatus to coach all of his son's little league teams. He also pursued his love of hip-hop by forming a group with his friend 'The Alchemist' (qv); as The Whooliganz, the duo made inroads on the music scene and signed an ill-fated contract with Tommy Boy Records.  It did not take long for Scott to appear in front of the camera; in 1995, he took roles in a couple independent films, _Aaron Gillespie Will Make You a Star (1995)_ (qv) and _A Boy Called Hate (1995)_ (qv). Critical of his performances, Scott enrolled at Playhouse West in Los Angeles to study acting. Roles in more indies followed, including _Bongwater (1997)_ (qv) and 'Gregg Araki' (qv)'s _Nowhere (1997)_ (qv).  His first major film was also a hit; he had a supporting role in _Enemy of the State (1998)_ (qv) for director 'Tony Scott (I)' (qv). He then appeared (in the buff) in _Varsity Blues (1999)_ (qv) as a wisecracking receiver. By now, Scott had built a reliable reputation for playing strong-minded characters with a sense of humor, exemplified by his work in movies such a _Boiler Room (2000)_ (qv), _Ready to Rumble (2000)_ (qv), and his second hit picture, _Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000)_ (qv).  Scott's star rose with a fun supporting turn in 'Steven Soderbergh' (qv)'s _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) remake. At this time he had more indie turns in the films _American Outlaws (2001)_ (qv), _Novocaine (2001)_ (qv), and _Sonny (2002)_ (qv) - 'Nicolas Cage' (qv)'s directorial debut starring 'James Franco' (qv). Scott followed up with his own directorial outing, _Dallas 362 (2003)_ (qv).  Scott reprised his role as Turk Malloy in _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv), then took a supporting roles in two very different pictures: the sexy, ocean-bound thriller _Into the Blue (2005)_ (qv) and in 'Nicole Holofcener' (qv)'s indie comedy, _Friends with Money (2006)_ (qv). 2006 marked Caan's return to the director¹s chair, with _The Dog Problem (2006)_ (qv), and soon was back for _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv).  Over the past few years, Scott made memorable appearances as a recurring character on _"Entourage" (2004)_ (qv). Currently, he has a starring role in the remake of the TV series _"Hawaii Five-0" (2010)_ (qv).  Scott has also established himself as a photographer, having been mentored in the medium by cinematographer 'Phil Parmet' (qv). In 2009, he published his book, Scott Caan Photographs, Vol. 1.</biographie>

Often labeled as a tough guy because of his roles, eclectic choices and talent have made of him a star of European cinema. First in _La haine (1995)_ (qv), the young actor, actually coming from upper classes, succeeded to express the despair of a social class living in the suburbs of towns. This veracity in his play comes from the fact that he was in fact since years in connection with many hip-hop artists from the rising generation, (his own brother was leader of a legendary french rap group). Then the success of The crimson rivers, where he plays a young French cop alongside 'Jean Reno (I)' (qv), made of him "the man to count on." He never hid his taste for rap music, break dance, Capoeira, Brasil and his endless energy, but Vincent is also a family man, married to 'Monica Bellucci' (qv), his Italian co-star from _L'appartement (1996)_ (qv) (aka The Apartment); and recently a father.</biographie>

      <synopsis>When Daniel Ocean is released from prison in New Jersey, his next heist is already planned. Danny's target are three Las Vegas casinos: The Bellagio, the Mirage and the MGM Grand. They all belong to ruthless entrepreneur Terry Benedict, who, by the way, also shows a certain interest in Danny's beautiful ex-wife Tess. During a much-anticipated boxing event (Lennox Lewis vs. Wladimir Klitschko), there will be $150 million in the safe, 70 yards below the strip. So, Danny starts to hire professionals from all over the country: There's the card magician Rusty Ryan, the perfect pickpocket Linus Caldwell and the ingenious pyrotechnician Basher Tarr. Reuben Tishkoff, who lost a casino to Benedict, provides funding, the brothers Virgil and Turk Malloy will drive and help, and Frank Catton, a professional card dealer, gets a job at the casino to watch the routines. Saul Bloom, already retired, will play the rich heavy weaponry dealer and live in the hotel, while Livingston Dell bugs the place to have a look over the shoulders of the security personnel. Finally, the chinese acrobat artist Yen will be the one to move inside the safe before the motion detectors are turned off. There are three rules to be followed: First: no blood. Second: Rob only who deserves it. Third: Do it as if you have nothing to lose. When the day of the boxing event finally draws near, all is set, and Benedict doesn't have a clue - or does he?</synopsis>

            <biographie>Bernard Jeffrey McCollough was born in Chicago in 1957. He grew up in Chicago, in a rougher neighborhood than most others, with a large family living under one roof. This situation provided him with a great insight into his comedy, as his family, and the situations surrounding them would be what dominated his comedy. Mac worked in the Regal Theater, and performed in Chicago parks in his younger days. He became a professional comedian in 1977, at the age of 19. He refused to change his image for television and films, and therefore was not very well known for most of the eighties. In 1992 he made his film debut with a small part with _Mo' Money (1992)_ (qv). This started a plethora of small parts in a string of movies, mostly comedies, including _Who's the Man? (1993)_ (qv), _House Party 3 (1994)_ (qv) and _The Walking Dead (1995)_ (qv). 1995 proved to be a turning point in his career. He did an HBO Special called _"Midnight Mac" (1995)_ (qv), and took a part as Pastor Clever in the Chris Tucker comedy _Friday (1995)_ (qv). Bernie Mac developed a cult following due to the movie and had many small parts since. In 1996 he starred in the memorable 'Spike Lee' (qv) movie _Get on the Bus (1996)_ (qv), and was very funny in _Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996)_ (qv). About this time he had a recurring role in the TV series _"Moesha" (1996)_ (qv). Bernie Mac's star was slowly rising from this point. His next couple of movie parts were more substantial, including _How to Be a Player (1997)_ (qv) and _The Players Club (1998)_ (qv). In 1999 Bernie Mac got his most high profile part up to that point in the film _Life (1999/I)_ (qv) starring 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv).  The new century started a new era for the brash Chicago comedian. He was a featured comedian in _The Original Kings of Comedy (2000)_ (qv). This performance made him more of a household name, and led to many more major parts. In 2001 he played Martin Lawrence's uncle in _What's the Worst That Could Happen? (2001)_ (qv) and later that year, was in the star studded remake of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv). However his biggest success was _"The Bernie Mac Show" (2001)_ (qv), which debuted in 2001 to instant acclaim. However, soon after the series ended, Mac's health took a turn for the worse. He developed sarcoidosis, an autoimmune disease which causes inflammation in the lungs. On August 9, 2008, after weeks of unsuccessful treatments, Bernie Mac died at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was 50.  Bernie Mac was a comedian that refused to change his image for Hollywood and said that his life in Chicago was who he was and there was nothing that could change that. He was a mature comedian who was very intelligent and very engaging in his TV, movie and stand-up appearances.</biographie>

            <biographie>Eydie Gorme was born in New York on August 16, 1928 to Sephardic Jewish parents. Her father, Nessim Garmezano, was a tailor, from Sicily, who changed his last name when he arrived in the United States. Gorme began singing straight out of high school, with various big bands. But her big break came after she auditioned for, and joined, "The _"Tonight!" (1953)_ (qv) Show" in 1953. There, for $90 a week, she sang solos and sang duets with the up-and-coming 'Steve Lawrence (I)' (qv). The two performed on the show for five years, and married in 1957. After their "Tonight Show" stint, the pair had a short-lived TV show of their own, _"The Steve Lawrence-Eydie Gorme Show" (1958)_ (qv). Then, Lawrence entered the Army leaving Gorme, a new mother, to frequent the night club circuit on her own. Two years later, when Lawrence was discharged, the couple came to a decision to enter show business more professionally. Their career took off, with audiences drawn to their penchant for the classics in favor of rock 'n' roll, as well as their spontaneous banter.</biographie>

Avoiding competition with his father, he quit his job as broadcast journalist after a short time.  George studied for a few years at Northern Kentucky University. He failed to join the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. He came to acting when his cousin, 'Miguel Ferrer (I)' (qv), got him a small part in a feature film. After that, in 1982, he moved to Los Angeles and tried for a whole year to get a role while he slept in a friend's closet. His first movie, together with 'Charlie Sheen' (qv), stayed unreleased but got him the producers' attention for later contracts.</biographie>

            <sexe valeur="MASCULIN"/>
            <biographie>Gregory Stenson grew up on the mean streets of Las Vegas, Nevada. Today we know him as the 6 foot box-office hero, but his growth spurt didn't occur to late in his teen years, thus his small size made him a target for bullies. The brutalities he endured as a youngster only made him stronger however and has helped to make him the person he is today. Greg has two loving parents and did the best they could with their lower class status. Gregory hated that his family didn't have all the things they would like to, things they saw while watching programs like The Jefferson's and Goodtimes. He wished his family could have such luxuries and live like these TV families did. His major goal in life became to do the best he could to make his families life the best it could possibly be!  His grades in school were never the best, and Gregory couldn't see himself as a suit anyway, so Gregory looked to other avenues to achieve his goal. It was about this time that his body caught up with and surpassed the size of his classmates, and it wasn't long before the coach of his High School Football Team noticed Gregory on campus. Greg took to Football like a fish to water and excelled greatly, his skills as a Line Backer helped drive his team to two State Championship wins. By his senior year Greg was a hot commodity and had scouts from colleges all over the country looking him over. Greg took his time deciding on who he should go with and finally decided on Antelope Valley College in beautiful Lancaster, California and the outstanding Marauders Football Team. While an odd choice it was nonetheless the one that Gregory made. His reasoning better to be a big fish in a small pond than a big fish in a much larger pond! His talents as a Line Backer once again proved strong here as they did in High School. He brought many victories to his team the Marauders through his tenure with them and was on the Fast Track to an NFL Career when tragedy struck in one the most prolific games of his college career. During the third down as the Quarter Back was looking for a clear Receiver and a shot to bring the team to victory, Gregory was holding the line with all he had. He had already held off to heavy blitzes on his QB but the last push was too much and he was overrun by two Rushers and was left lying on the ground after the play was through. Gregory didn't get up and his teammates ran to his side, where they found him screaming in agony.  Gregory was rushed to the local hospital where it was found that his Bicep muscle was entirely ripped from his bone. A terrible injury to have and one that took many months of reconstructive surgery and therapy to correct. Unfortunately this spelled the end of Gregory's football career as the doctor told him one more injury like this and they don't know what would happen!  Greg became disillusioned with life and fell into a very dark period in his life, (little is known about this part of his life?) but re-emerged a year later with new determination and with his original goal of a better life for himself and his family at the forefront once more. Gregory had endless nights without sleep trying to figure out how he could make his dream come true, then it hit him like a blitz from a forward in his football days. While thinking about the TV shows he loved so much as a kid, he thought he could play those parts as good if not better than say J.J. did on Goodtimes. So with a new resolve he decided to be an actor.  Just as Gregory had chosen an obscure approach to his Football College Career, he again chose the same method on his way to his Hollywood Movie Actor Career. Gregory didn't head to Los Angeles or New York as most people do, instead he went to back to Sin City itself, Las Vegas. He knew that more and more movies were being shot there and decided that a big fish in a smaller pond was good enough for him this time as well. He signed with many different agencies as soon as he arrived back in Vegas and not surprisingly was given a very warm reception. His good looks and boyish charm did very well for Gregory indeed. As his agents looked for work for him, sometimes staying up very late to make sure Gregory was looked at seriously for some of the bigger roles, Gregory knew he couldn't just wait for that "right" acting role to come along so he branched off to "character acting."  His agents found him work at The Aladdin Casino playing a Genie. Greg enjoyed this work immensely, he loved it when the tourists would smile at him and ask for a photo with him, he thought to himself, "Well if this is what its like to be a big-time movie actor, I think I'm gonna love it." While playing the Genie he continually went out on auditions, sometimes he would miss some of his work playing Genie, but his producers understood his need to move his career along and gave him time off as needed. While he had not won any parts on the screen or TV yet, he continually tried, knocking down many barriers as he tried. After a year of playing Genie he thought he had explored all the realms of the character so he decided he needed something fresh as it wasn't fair to him or "Genie" to keep playing a character he saw as "evolved". So without another job to go to he bid the Aladdin farewell.  But it wasn't long before Caesar's Palace heard Gregory was available and immediately made an offer to him to play "Marc Anthony" at their casino. Gregory couldn't believe his luck, the role of Marc Anthony was one of the most sought-after roles in Vegas. Here he was being offered the role without even an audition! Gregory loved his new role and explored all facets of the character in his day to day workings.  Greg's movie career also got a shot in the arm at this time as well. One of his agents found him a very small role in the comedy hit "Bubble Boy". Greg played of all things a security guard in this picture, having never had any experience as a security guard in real life, he learned all he could about his role, going as far as doing temp work as one, before filming started to get an idea of what the character should be about. When the time came to shoot Gregory was more than ready, and brought to the part more that even the writer had hoped to see. Gregory was on his way!  While he continued his Marc Anthony role he went for more and more auditions, picking up a commercial or music video starring role along the way. Gregory's biggest break came when "Bubble Boy" was released and one of the producers assistants of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv), 'Harvey Weintrapper' saw Gregory and his performance. In the script of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) there was a part for a white security officer, and this part was very critical to the unfolding of the whole plot of the movie. Weintrapper called Gregory in and gave him a shot at the part, Gregory with all his zeal again researched the part prior to the meeting. To understand the role he shadowed one of Caesar's Hotel security men for a day to see what it was all about. When Gregory read the part, Weintrapper was blown away, he had expected a great read from Gregory but this was beyond all expectations. Even though Gregory differed from the original characters concept, they decided to take a chance.  _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) became a stunning hit spectacular and owed this in no small way to Gregory Stenson's portrayal of The Sentry in his stunning scene that featured him along with two actors each from a Dynasty of acting Royalty. Gregory's role paired him up against the dynamic Scott Caan (James Caan's Son) and Casey Affleck (Ben Affleck's Brother and best buddy as well of Matt Damon). Both Scott and Casey were most impressed with Gregory's work and invited him to hang out with them after the shoot thus beginning a friendship that lasts to this day. It is a little known secret around insider circles that the three of them are looking at a "western" script to do together.</biographie>

            <biographie>American actor Casey Affleck has an onscreen career dating back to 1988, but his Academy Award nominated work in _The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)_ (qv) gained him wider acclaim in recent years.  Affleck, the younger brother of 'Ben Affleck' (qv), was born Caleb Casey McGuire Affleck-Boldt on 12 August 1975 in Falmouth, Massachusetts to middle-class parents; his mother was a school district employee and teacher, and father was a drug counselor who also served as a social worker, auto mechanic, custodian and bartender. He was also part of the Theater Company of Boston.  Affleck appeared in various roles on television while finishing high school and attending university, including as young Robert Kennedy in the TV mini-series _"The Kennedys of Massachusetts" (1990)_ (qv). After graduating high school, he attended George Washington University and eventually transferred into Columbia University in New York, but he never earned his Bachelor's degree.  Affleck's first major film role was in 'Gus Van Sant' (qv)'s _To Die For (1995)_ (qv), in which he co-starred with his future brother-in-law 'Joaquin Phoenix' (qv) and 'Nicole Kidman' (qv). He would go on to appear in two films with his brother, _Chasing Amy (1997)_ (qv) and _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), which 'Ben Affleck' (qv) co-wrote with 'Matt Damon' (qv). Affleck then chose a variety of roles, most of which were considered to be commercial failures, including _Drowning Mona (2000)_ (qv), a modern version of _Hamlet (2000)_ (qv) and _Soul Survivors (2001)_ (qv). He also co-wrote the screenplay _Gerry (2002)_ (qv) with 'Gus Van Sant' (qv) and 'Matt Damon' (qv), which received a limited release in the United States.  But 2001 brought Affleck a plum role as part of Ocean's Eleven's ensemble cast. Affleck's character, a getaway driver named Virgil Malloy, reappeared in _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv) and _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv). Affleck also received positive critical notice for his work in _Gone Baby Gone (2007)_ (qv), and directed 'Joaquin Phoenix' (qv) in the "hoax-umentary" _I'm Still Here (2010/I)_ (qv). He also recently co-starred in the ensemble comedy _Tower Heist (2011)_ (qv).  Affleck has signed on to star in the independent movie _Ain't Them Bodies Saints (2013)_, described as a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-inspired tale about an escaped convict on the run through Texas, trying to reunite with his wife and daughter. He is married 'Summer Phoenix' (qv), to whom he was introduced by her brother Joaquin. The couple has two sons.</biographie>

After appearing in dozens of local commercials, Scott landed the part of "State Trooper" on the WB TV series "The Strip", his first SAG part, and later joked with Carl saying, "If didn't get that part, I shouldn't be acting". He was catching the eyes of prominent Vegas casting directors, most notably, Ray Favaro and Merilee Lear and movie auditions began to come his way. Steven Soderbergh personally thanked Scott for making the Ocean's Eleven Airport Scene spectacular. As an honorably retired State Trooper, Scott gives law enforcement roles added realism and performs them flawlessly. He is sure, the best is yet to come!</biographie>

            <biographie>Carl Reiner is a legend of American comedy, having achieved great success as a comic actor, a director, producer and recording artist. He has won nine Emmy Awards, three as an actor, three as a writer and two as a producer. He also won a Grammy Award for his "10,000 Year Old Man" album, based on his comedy routine with 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv).  Reiner was born in The Bronx. His father Irving, a Romanian immigrant, was a watchmaker; his mother, Bessie (née Mathias), had been born in Austria. At the age of 16, while working as a sewing machine repairman, he attended a dramatic workshop sponsored by the Works Progress Administration. The direction of his life was set.  In the 1970s, some sources claimed that Reiner made his movie debut in _New Faces of 1937 (1937)_ (qv), but that is unlikely as he would have only been 15-years-old at the time. (Interesting, that movie shares the same plot as his erstwhile partner 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv)' 1968 classic, _The Producers (1967)_ (qv), with a crooked producer planning to fleece his "angels" by producing a flop and absconding with the money). He didn't appear on screen, silver or small, until he made his TV debut in 1948 in the short-lived TV series, _"The Fashion Story" (1948)_ (qv), then became a regular, the following year, on _"The Fifty-Fourth Street Revue" (1949), another TV series with a brief life.  Reiner made his Broadway debut in 1949 in the musical "Inside U.S.A.", a hit that ran for 399 performances. His next Broadway show, the 1950 musical revue, "Alive and Kicking", was a flop, lasting just 43 performances. 'Max Liebman' (qv), the producer/director/writer/composer, had been called in to provide additional material after the show's troubled six week out-of-town preview in Boston. It didn't help -- the show closed after six weeks on Broadway -- but an important contact had been made.  Leibman was a producer-director on _"Your Show of Shows" (1950)_ (qv), one of the great TV series, and he hired Reiner to appear on the show in the middle of its first season. Reiner's first gig on the revue-like show was interviewing "The Professor", a character played by 'Sid Caesar' (qv). He became central to the comedy portions of the show and, in 1953, he racked up the first of six Emmy nominations for acting. (In all, he was nominated for an Emmy Award a total of 13 times). When, in 1954, "Your Show of Shows" was split up by the network into its constituent parts, Reiner continued on with Sid in _"Caesar's Hour" (1954)_ (qv). ('Imogene Coca' (qv) was given her own show, which lasted one season, and Leibman was allowed to produced specials).  "Your Show or Shows" had been a Broadway-style revue, featuring skits such as dancing (including a young 'Bob Fosse' (qv)) whereas "Caesar's Hour" was pure comedy. "Your Show of Shows" had had a great cast, another other than Coca, most of the cast, including Reiner, 'Howard Morris (I)' (qv), and 'Nanette Fabray' (qv) (who went on to win an Emmy) moved over to "Caesar's Hour". In his three seasons on the show, he was nominated three more times for a Best Supporting Actor Emmy, winning twice in 1957 and 1958. But it was its stable of comedy writers that was essential to the great success of both "Your Show of Shows" and "Caesar's Hour". In addition to 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv), the writing staff included 'Neil Simon (I)' (qv), his brother 'Danny Simon (I)' (qv), 'Larry Gelbart' (qv) and 'Mel Tolkin' (qv). (There are rumors that the young 'Woody Allen' (qv) served as the writing staff's typist).  Reiner had sat in informally with the writers during "Your Show of Shows", but he began writing formally for "Caesar's Hour", having learned his craft from all of the other writers. As a self-described uncredited "writer without portfolio", he was able to leave writers' meetings at 6 PM, if he wanted to. This gave him the time to work on a semi-autobiographical novel. Published in 1958, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv) is about a young man in 1930s New York trying to make it in show business. It was transformed into a play and, eventually, adapted into a movie in 1967, and a musical, many years later.  In 1959, he created the pilot for a TV series, "Man of the House", in which he would play a writer, "Rob Petrie", who balanced his family life with the demands of working as a writer for a comedy show headlined by an egotistical comedic genius modeled after 'Sid Caesar' (qv) (a "benign despot" who lacked social skills, according to Reiner). The series was rooted in his experience on "Your Show of Shows" and "Caesar's Hour". The network didn't pick up the pilot at first, as CBS executives claimed the main character, which was clearly autobiographical on Reiner's part, was too New York, too Jewish and too intellectual. In 1960, Reiner teamed up with 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv) on _"The Steve Allen Show" (1956)_ (qv), and their routine "The 2000 Year Old Man" was a huge success. Reiner played the straight man to Brooks in the routine, which was spun-off into five comedy albums, bringing them a Grammy Award. They also made an animated TV special based on their shtick in 1975.  Though CBS turned down "Man of the House", with the two-time Emmy-winning comedian Reiner as the lead, it was still interested in the series. However, they wanted a WASP in the role of "Rob Petrie" to ensure the broad appeal of the show, and the casting of the protagonist came down to 'Johnny Carson (I)' (qv) and 'Dick Van Dyke' (qv). Carson was a game show host of no great note at the time, but Van Dyke was in the smash Broadway musical, _Bye Bye Birdie (1963)_ (qv), for which he won a Tony Award. He got the part and another chapter of TV history was made, when 'Mary Tyler Moore' (qv), 'Rose Marie (I)' (qv) and 'Morey Amsterdam' (qv) all were cast in leading roles. Reiner, himself, would eventually play the role of "Alan Brady", the abrasive 'Sid Caesar' (qv)-like comic convinced of his own genius, in the last few seasons of the series' five-year run.  Another milestone in TV comedy, _"The Dick Van Dyke Show" (1961)_ (qv), brought Reiner five more Emmies, three for writing and two as the producer of the series. In 1966, Reiner and the other principals, including executive producer 'Sheldon Leonard' (qv) and Dick Van Dyke, decided to end the series at the height of its popularity and critical acclaim. (The show won Emmies as best show and best comedy in 1965 and 1966, respectively). Twenty-nine years after the show was ended, Reiner reprised the role of "Alan Brady" on _"Mad About You" (1992)_ (qv), winning his eighth (and so far, last) Emmy Award, this time as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.  It was on "The Dick Van Dyke Show" that Reiner first became a director. His feature film debut, as a director, was with the film adaptation of the play 'Joseph Stein' (qv) had adapted from his 1958 novel, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv). His work as a writer-director, with 'Dick Van Dyke' (qv), in creating a 'Stan Laurel' (qv)-type character in _The Comic (1969)_ (qv) was not a success, but _Where's Poppa? (1970)_ (qv) became a cult classic and _Oh, God! (1977)_ (qv), with 'George Burns (I)' (qv), and _The Jerk (1979)_ (qv), with 'Steve Martin (I)' (qv), were smash hits. The last movie he directed was the 1997 comedy, _That Old Feeling (1997)_ (qv).  Reiner's career has continued on into the 21st Century, when most of his contemporaries had retired. He was awarded the 'Mark Twain' (qv) Prize for American Humor in 2000 and, starting in 2001, he acted in the remake of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) and its two sequels. Most recently, he has appeared as a voice artist in the animated series, _"The Cleveland Show" (2009)_ (qv) (he even wrote an episode for the series rooted in his "Your Show of Shows" experience) and has appeared as a regular on the TV series, _"Hot in Cleveland" (2010)_ (qv) (with fellow nonagenarian 'Betty White (I)' (qv)), as well as appeared on an episode of _"Parks and Recreation" (2009)_ (qv) in 2012.</biographie>

            <biographie>After a long amateur career that included a gold medal winning performance in the 1988 Seoul Olympics that came in the form of a KO of 'Riddick Bowe' (who also went on to win the world heavyweight crown), former undisputed world heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis turned professional in 1989. His 2 round win over Canadian boxer Donnovan Ruddock in Oct of 1992 gained him recognition as a threat among the tough heavyweight ranks. Lewis, a citizen of England and Canada, was slated for a shot at the winner of 'Evander Holyfield' (qv) vs Riddick Bowe. Bowe, a victim of a brutal knockout suffered at the hands of Lewis in the amateur ranks, refused to live up to his end of the bargain by not giving Lewis a well-deserved title shot and infamously tossed the WBC title in a garbage bin. This act prompted the WBC commission to strip Bowe and crown Lewis as the new WBC champion. Lennox Lewis went on to defend the crown for several fights until he was defeated by Oliver McCall in 2 rounds in Sept of 1994. Lewis, with the help of new trainer 'Emanuel Steward' (qv), came back and began tearing his way through the ranks of the heavyweight division. Lewis was again denied a title shot when champion 'Mike Tyson (I)' (qv) relinquished his WBC title to fight 'Evander Holyfield' (qv) rather than risk his titles against Lewis. Lewis recaptured the vacant WBC title by beating his conquerer Oliver McCall in a rematch. Lewis, after defeating every top contender thrown his way, was given his shot at 'Evander Holyfield' (qv) in a championship unification fight on March 13, 1999. Lewis dominated the fight but due to controversial judging, the bout was declared a draw. Lewis defeated 'Evander Holyfield' (qv) in a rematch on Nov 13, 1999 to become undisputed world champion. Due to promoter 'Don King (I)' (qv)'s underhanded tactics, the WBA belt was stripped from Lewis in court. Lewis went on to beat every mandatory challenger while keeping his crown. While avidly issuing challenges to reluctant contender 'Mike Tyson (I)' (qv), Lewis went to Johannesburg in South Africa at the invitation of 'Nelson Mandela' (qv). Lewis would defend his titles against supposed low-risk opponent Hasim Rahman. Due to Lewis' failure to prepare for the fight by dropping excessive weight rapidly, arriving in Johannesburg 2 weeks before the fight which, according to expert opinion, was too late to acclimatize to the thin air since Johannesburg was 5,000 feet above sea level, Lewis suffered one of the biggest upsets in boxing history. However, Lewis has had his rematch with Hashim Rahman and won the title back, and he also fought 'Mike Tyson (I)' (qv) and beaten him 'easily' in 8 rounds.</biographie>

            <biographie>Muscular, swaggering and tough, Scott Caan gives every indication of becoming a "man's-man" like his father, legendary actor 'James Caan (I)' (qv). While it is obvious that he admires tough method actors like 'Marlon Brando' (qv) and 'Sean Penn (I)' (qv), Scott also has a strong egalitarian streak, evidenced by his reasoning for baring his body in films. He is quoted as saying that originally only the women in the scene were to be nude, but that he felt it really sexist, so he stripped too.  Scott was born on August 23, 1976 in Los Angeles, California. He spent his childhood being shuttled between his parent's homes. His mom is actress and model 'Sheila Ryan (II)' (qv); the Caans divorced when Scott was a year old. He has an older half-sister, Tara, and three younger half-brothers: Alexander, Jacob, and James.  Self-desribed as a bad kid who was always getting into trouble, Scott initially steered clear of acting, opting to play sports instead. Scott benefited from his father's hands-on approach to child rearing; the elder Caan reportedly took a five-year hiatus to coach all of his son's little league teams. He also pursued his love of hip-hop by forming a group with his friend 'The Alchemist' (qv); as The Whooliganz, the duo made inroads on the music scene and signed an ill-fated contract with Tommy Boy Records.  It did not take long for Scott to appear in front of the camera; in 1995, he took roles in a couple independent films, _Aaron Gillespie Will Make You a Star (1995)_ (qv) and _A Boy Called Hate (1995)_ (qv). Critical of his performances, Scott enrolled at Playhouse West in Los Angeles to study acting. Roles in more indies followed, including _Bongwater (1997)_ (qv) and 'Gregg Araki' (qv)'s _Nowhere (1997)_ (qv).  His first major film was also a hit; he had a supporting role in _Enemy of the State (1998)_ (qv) for director 'Tony Scott (I)' (qv). He then appeared (in the buff) in _Varsity Blues (1999)_ (qv) as a wisecracking receiver. By now, Scott had built a reliable reputation for playing strong-minded characters with a sense of humor, exemplified by his work in movies such a _Boiler Room (2000)_ (qv), _Ready to Rumble (2000)_ (qv), and his second hit picture, _Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000)_ (qv).  Scott's star rose with a fun supporting turn in 'Steven Soderbergh' (qv)'s _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) remake. At this time he had more indie turns in the films _American Outlaws (2001)_ (qv), _Novocaine (2001)_ (qv), and _Sonny (2002)_ (qv) - 'Nicolas Cage' (qv)'s directorial debut starring 'James Franco' (qv). Scott followed up with his own directorial outing, _Dallas 362 (2003)_ (qv).  Scott reprised his role as Turk Malloy in _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv), then took a supporting roles in two very different pictures: the sexy, ocean-bound thriller _Into the Blue (2005)_ (qv) and in 'Nicole Holofcener' (qv)'s indie comedy, _Friends with Money (2006)_ (qv). 2006 marked Caan's return to the director¹s chair, with _The Dog Problem (2006)_ (qv), and soon was back for _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv).  Over the past few years, Scott made memorable appearances as a recurring character on _"Entourage" (2004)_ (qv). Currently, he has a starring role in the remake of the TV series _"Hawaii Five-0" (2010)_ (qv).  Scott has also established himself as a photographer, having been mentored in the medium by cinematographer 'Phil Parmet' (qv). In 2009, he published his book, Scott Caan Photographs, Vol. 1.</biographie>

            <biographie>Angie Dickinson was born in Kulm, North Dakota, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. L. H. Brown. Mr. Brown was the publisher of The Kulm Messenger. The family left North Dakota in 1942 when Angie was 11 years old, moving to Burbank, California. In December 1946, when she was a senior at Bellamarine Jefferson High School in Burbank, she won the Sixth Annual Bill of Rights Contest. Two years later, her sister Janet did likewise. Being the daughter of a printer, Angie at first had visions of becoming a writer, but gave this up after winning her first beauty contest. After finishing college, she worked as a secretary in a Burbank airplane parts factory for 3-1/2 years. In 1953, she entered the local Miss America contest one day before the deadline and took second place. In August of the same year, she was one of five winners in a beauty contest sponsored by NBC and appeared in several television variety shows. She got her first bit part in a Warner Brothers film in 1954 and gained fame in the television series _"The Millionaire" (1955)_ (qv) and got her first good film role opposite 'John Wayne (I)' (qv) and 'Dean Martin (I)' (qv) in _Rio Bravo (1959)_ (qv). Her success then spiraled until she became one of the nation's top movie stars.</biographie>

            <biographie>J.P. Manoux grew up on the beaches of Santa Barbara, California, the oldest of seven. He was involved in children's theatre productions and took tap dance lessons before attending the Thacher School in Ojai, California. Curiously, that tiny boarding school would provide no less than 3 doctors for NBC's long running hospital drama ER (Noah Wyle and Leland Orser, the other two). As college applications approached, Manoux's drama teacher recommended the undergraduate theatre department at Northwestern University.  Surrounded by Chicago's vibrant theatre scene, J.P. became passionate about improv and sketch comedy. Upon graduating and moving to Hollywood, he sharpened his own comedy chops at L.A. Theatresports, ACME Comedy Theatre, The Groundlings School, and I.O. West. Legit stage productions garnered critical accolades, culminating in 1999 with L.A. Ovation and Backstage West Garland Awards recognizing his work in the world premiere stage musical Reefer Madness.  Over the next few years, J.P. appeared in dozens of TV sitcoms and national commercials including campaigns for Got Milk? and Fruit of the Loom. He was a regular improviser and sketch player on ABC's 2001 prime-time variety experiment The Wayne Brady Show and he became a celebrity in the world of children's television thanks to his dual role as "Mr. Hackett" and "Curtis the Caveman" on the Disney Channel series Phil of the Future. During this period, he also voiced the lead role of "Kuzco" in Disney's animated series The Emperor's New School. In 2006, J.P. joined the ensemble of ER, recurring as surgical resident Dustin Crenshaw. It would prove to be a shrewd casting move, widely regarded (in the Manoux household) as the single most significant factor in returning the venerable series to its original acclaim, prestige, and sex appeal.  Opportunities to act and direct in Canada led Manoux to pursue immigration north of the border. The Toronto based productions of DisneyXD's sci-fi/adventure series Aaron Stone and Teletoon's hybrid animation comedy series Mud pit saw him working both in front of and behind the camera. Still a U.S. citizen, but now a permanent resident of Canada, Manoux routinely hops the border for film and television work, including his recurring role on Community as "The Deanelganger". He hopes to continue spending summers in Toronto, acting in the new CTV multi-camera sitcom Spun Out which stars Dave Foley of The Kids in the Hall and Newsradio fame.  J.P. Manoux has appeared in over 30 feature films, 90 different television series, and 90 commercials. He has provided voice and motion capture performance for 8 video games, competed as a contestant or celebrity panelist on 6 gameshows, read 2 original pieces for All Things Condsidered on National Public Radio, co-written 1 play, and anonymously authored 1 biography.</biographie>

            <biographie>Henry Silva was born on September 15, 1928 in Brooklyn, New York City. He quit public school to attend drama classes at age 13, supporting himself as a dishwasher in a Manhattan hotel. By 1955, Silva had moved up from dishwasher to waiter, and felt ready to audition for the Actors Studio. He was one of five students chosen out of more than 2500 applicants. When the Actors Studio staged 'Michael V. Gazzo' (qv)'s play "A Hatful of Rain" as a classroom project, it proved so successful it came to Broadway--with students 'Ben Gazzara (I)' (qv), 'Shelley Winters' (qv), 'Harry Guardino' (qv), 'Anthony Franciosa (I)' (qv) and, of course, Silva in key roles. Called to Hollywood, he played a succession of heavies in films, including _The Bravados (1958)_ (qv), _Green Mansions (1959)_ (qv), _Ocean's Eleven (1960)_ (qv), _The Manchurian Candidate (1962)_ (qv) and _Johnny Cool (1963)_ (qv).  An Italian producer made Henry an offer he could not refuse--to star as a hero for a change--and he moved his family overseas. Silva's turning-point picture was a spaghetti western, _Un fiume di dollari (1966)_ (qv), which made him a hot box office commodity in Spain, Italy, Germany and France. His popularity was enhanced by a gift for languages. He speaks Italian and Spanish fluently and has a flair for the kind of gritty, realistic roles that also catapulted 'Charles Bronson (I)' (qv) to European stardom. Returning to the United States, he co-starred with 'Frank Sinatra' (qv) in the film _Contract on Cherry Street (1977) (TV)_ (qv), then signed on as Buck Rogers' evil adversary Kane in _Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (1979) (TV)_ (qv) and the television series of the same name. Silva now calls the San Fernando Valley home, but makes continual film forays back to Europe's production centers. A dedicated jogger, he puts in five miles a day "to keep in shape and relieve tension".</biographie>

            <biographie>Julia Fiona Roberts, born in Smyrna, Georgia, never dreamed she would become the most popular actress in America. As a child, due to her love of animals, Julia originally wanted to be a veterinarian, but later studied journalism. When her brother, 'Eric Roberts (I)' (qv), achieved some success in Hollywood, Julia decided to try acting. Her first break came in 1988 when she appeared in two youth-oriented movies _Mystic Pizza (1988)_ (qv) and _Satisfaction (1988)_ (qv). The movies introduced her to a new audience who instantly fell in love with this pretty woman. Julia's biggest success was in the signature movie _Pretty Woman (1990)_ (qv), for which Julia got an Oscar nomination, and also won the People's Choice award for Favorite Actress. Even though Julia would spend the next few years either starring in serious movies, or playing fantasy roles like Tinkerbell, the movie audiences would always love Julia best in romantic comedies. With _My Best Friend's Wedding (1997)_ (qv) Julia gave the genre fresh life that had been lacking in Hollywood for some time. Offscreen, after a brief marriage, Julia has been romantically linked with several other actors. Julia has also become involved with UNICEF charities and has made visits to many different countries, including Haiti and India, in order to promote goodwill. Julia is one of the most popular and sought-after talents in Hollywood.</biographie>

            <biographie>Matthew Paige Damon, or better known to fans as Matt Damon was born in Boston Massachusetts, USA to 'Kent Damon' (qv), a stockbroker, Realtor and tax preparer, and 'Nancy Carlsson-Paige' (qv), an early childhood education professor at Lesley University. Matt has an older brother named Kyle who is now a sculptor. Unfortunately for Matt and his brother, their parents divorced in the year 1973.  The 5'10" star is of English, Scottish, Finnish, and Swedish ancestry. While his parents were still together, their family lived in Newton, before eventually settling for a divorce, where Damon and his brother moved with his mother to Cambridge. He grew up in a stable community back in Massachusetts. Matt also grew up near actor 'Ben Affleck' (qv), when he was younger.  Matt attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School which is located in Cambridge and he performed in a number of theater productions during his time there. Later on, he was accepted into Harvard University as an English major in the fall of 1988 and was supposed to graduate with the class of 1992. While in Harvard, he kept on skipping classes to pursue acting projects, which included the TNT original film, _Rising Sun (1993)_ (qv), and prep-school drama, _School Ties (1992)_ (qv). It was until his film, _Geronimo: An American Legend (1993)_ (qv), was expected to be a big success that he decided to drop out of university completely.  Arriving in Hollywood, Matt managed to get his first break with a part in the romantic comedy, _Mystic Pizza (1988)_ (qv). However, the film did not do too well and his film career failed to take off. Not letting failure discourage him from acting, he went for another audition, and managed to get a starring role in _School Ties (1992)_ (qv).  Up next for Matt was a role as a soldier who had problems with drug-addiction in the movie, _Courage Under Fire (1996)_ (qv). Matt had, in fact, lost forty pounds for his role which resulted in health problems. The following year, he garnered accolades for _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), a screenplay he had originally written for an English class at Harvard University. _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv) was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, one of which, Matt won for Best Original Screenplay along with 'Ben Affleck' (qv).  In the year 1998, Matt played the title role in 'Steven Spielberg' (qv)'s film, _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv), which was one of the most acclaimed films in that year. Matt had the opportunity of working with 'Tom Hanks' (qv) and 'Vin Diesel' (qv) while filming that movie. That same year, he starred as an earnest law student and reformed poker player in _Rounders (1998)_ (qv), starring opposite 'Edward Norton (I)' (qv) and 'John Malkovich' (qv).  The next year, Matt rejoined his childhood friend, 'Ben Affleck' (qv) and fellow comedian, 'Chris Rock (I)' (qv), in the comedy _Dogma (1999)_ (qv). Towards the end of 1999, Matt played "Tom Ripley", a working-class young man who tastes the good life and will do anything to live it. Both 'Jude Law' (qv) and 'Gwyneth Paltrow' (qv) also starred in the movie. _The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)_ (qv) earned mixed reviews from critics, but even so, Matt earned praise for his performance.  Matt lent his voice to the animated movie, _Titan A.E. (2000)_ (qv) in the year 2000, which also earned mixed reviews from the public. He also starred in two other movies, _All the Pretty Horses (2000)_ (qv) and the golf comedy-drama, _The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)_ (qv), starring alongside 'Will Smith (I)' (qv).  In the year 2003, he signed on to star in _The Informant! (2009)_ (qv) by 'Steven Soderbergh' (qv) and the Farrelly Brothers' _Stuck on You (2003)_ (qv). He also starred in _Gerry (2002)_ (qv), a film he co-wrote with his friends, 'Gus Van Sant' (qv) and 'Casey Affleck' (qv).  One of Matt's most recognizable work to date is his role in the "Bourne" movie franchise. He plays an amnesiac assassin, "Jason Bourne", in _The Bourne Identity (2002)_ (qv), _The Bourne Supremacy (2004)_ (qv) and _The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)_ (qv).  Another praised role is that as "Linus Caldwell" in the "Ocean's" movie franchise. He had the opportunity to star opposite 'George Clooney' (qv), 'Brad Pitt' (qv), 'Julia Roberts (I)' (qv) and 'Don Cheadle' (qv) in _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv). The successful crime comedy-drama eventually had two other sequels, _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv) and _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv).  Among other highly acclaimed movies that Matt managed to be a part of was in 'Terry Gilliam' (qv)'s _The Brothers Grimm (2005)_ (qv), 'George Clooney' (qv)'s _Syriana (2005)_ (qv), 'Martin Scorsese' (qv)'s _The Departed (2006)_ (qv) and 'Robert De Niro' (qv)'s _The Good Shepherd (2006)_ (qv).  In his personal life, Matt is now happily married to Argentine-born 'Luciana Barroso' (qv), whom he met in Miami, where she was working as a bartender. They married in a private civil ceremony on December 9, 2005, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. The couple have four daughters Alexia, Luciana's daughter from a previous relationship, as well as Isabella, Gia and Stella.  Matt is a big fan of the Boston Red Sox and he tries to attend their games whenever possible. He has also formed great friendships with his Ocean's co-stars, 'George Clooney' (qv) and 'Brad Pitt' (qv), whom he works on charity projects with. He and actor 'Ben Affleck' (qv), together with Ben's wife, 'Jennifer Garner (I)' (qv), are also good family friends and can be often seen going out together with Matt's wife, 'Luciana Barroso' (qv).</biographie>

            <biographie>As a youngster, Andres "Andy" Garcia dreamed of playing professional baseball. Born on the Island of Cuba, Garcia's family fled to Miami Beach, Florida in the United States of America following Fidel Castro's communist revolution. At Natilus Junior High School and later at Miami Beach Senior High School, Garcia excelled in baseball.

Jensen was a South Florida legend, counting among his numerous students, 'Brett Ratner' (qv), 'Roy Firestone (I)' (qv), 'Mickey Rourke' (qv), and 'Luther Campbell' (qv). Following his positive high school experiences in acting, he continued his drama studies at Florida International University.

          <texte>Un de mes films préférés. "Ocean's Eleven", c'est d'abord un casting comme on en voit rarement au cinéma, c'est aussi une intrigue qui tient en haleine pendant tout le film et une réalisation impeccable de Steven Soderbergh. On ne s'ennuie pas une seule seconde, ce film est une perle, une oeuvre comme on en voit rarement au cinéma. Il y a aussi la musique qui colle parfaitement au cadre pendant tout le long du film. Je conseil vraiment ce film, que ce soit aux amateurs ou aux vrais cinéphiles. "Ocean's Eleven" est un film avec, un scénario parfait, qui est très drôle et très rafraîchissant, un film que l'on peut regarder à n'importe quel moment de la journée, que ce soit le soir ou en plein après-midi. Franchement, c'est un film qu'il faut voir au moins une fois.</texte>
