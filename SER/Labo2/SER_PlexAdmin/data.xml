      <titre>Django Unchained</titre>
      <synopsis>In 1858, in Texas, the former German dentist Dr. King Schultz meets the slave Django in a lonely road while being transported by the slavers Speck Brothers. He asks if Django knows the Brittle Brothers and with the affirmative, he buys Django for him. Then Dr. Schultz tells that he is a bounty hunter chasing John, Ellis and Roger Brittle and proposes a deal to Django: if he helps him, he would give his freedom, a horse and US$ 75.00 for him. Django accepts the deal and Dr. Schultz trains him to be his deputy. They kill the brothers in Daughtray and Django tells that he would use the money to buy the freedom of his wife Broomhilda, who is a slave that speaks German. Dr. Schultz proposes another deal to Django: if he teams-up with him during the winter, he would give one-third of the rewards and help him to rescue Broomhilda. Django accepts his new deal and they become friends. After the winter, Dr. Schultz goes to Gatlinburgh and learns that Broomhilda was sold to the ruthless Calvin Candie von Shaft, who lives in the Candyland Farm, in Mississippi. Dr. Schultz plots a scheme with Django to lure Calvin and rescue Broomhilda from him. But his cruel minion Stephen is not easily fooled.</synopsis>

            <biographie>Actor/writer/producer Todd Allen counts 'Gregory Peck' (qv), 'Marlon Brando' (qv), 'Steve McQueen (I)' (qv), John Wayne, Alan Ladd, Ward Bond, Lee Marvin and 'Robert Mitchum' (qv) among those actors who both influenced and inspired him to be an actor.  Allen has appeared in over 50 film and television productions and considers himself fortunate to have had the ability and opportunity to work in both film and television. He is filming the inspirational sports drama, "My All American" written and directed by Angelo Pizzo and most recently appeared in Quentin Tarantino's blockbuster Django Unchained as a very Gary Cooper-eque (according to Tarantino) plantation overseer named, "Dollar Bill." In another recent film, Allen completed a starring role in the independent feature, _Frontera (2010)_ (qv), playing a tough, driven Texas Ranger who brings down a powerful drug cartel. The film is yet to be released, but Allen remains hopeful that it will find a market. Recent television appearances include the NBC/Bruckheimer Pilot, _Chase (2010)_ (qv) and a recurring role on _"Friday Night Lights" (2006)_ (qv). Allen also co-starred with 'Robert Duvall' (qv) in Duvall's Academy Award-nominated film, _The Apostle (1997)_ (qv) and, more recently, co-starred with Duvall again in AMC's Emmy Award-winning original mini-series, _"Broken Trail" (2006)_ (qv), playing the well-reviewed role of "Marshal Bill Miller," a man who carries severed human ears on his watch chain. In _American Identity (2007)_ (qv), Allen both produced and co-starred as a battle-hardened Marine Master Sergeant, with a sly sense of humor and a definite command of the battle field, in the deserts of Afghanistan. Other career highlights include three films with 'Lawrence Kasdan' (qv), three films with 'Kevin Costner' (qv), and playing fighter ace 'Chuck Yeager' (qv) in a Hallmark Hall of Fame special presentation. He has many guest-starring roles on television, including appearances on _"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" (2000)_ (qv), _"NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service" (2003)_ (qv), _"Monk" (2002)_ (qv), and a movie for Hallmark entitled _Claire (2007) (TV)_ (qv).  Allen will launch an independent media and production company in 2014 and has a number of exceptional feature film properties and television projects in development. Among them are two film projects he plans to direct. Allen has also written several highly regarded screenplays. His first screenplay, a gritty, film-noir styled Western, "The Deserters", was the subject of much competition among studios but Allen held the project for its original intent which was a starring role for himself. Since Allen is now gray headed and has low back problems, he is now considering directing the film rather than starring in it so he doesn't have to do any more of his own stunts. Other well received screenplays include, "Suicide Grip," a romantic thrill ride set against the exciting backdrop of the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas. "The Empty Quarter," is a cautionary tale set on an explosive gas well in Saudi Arabia's most barren desert and "Rio Grande" is based on the best selling memoir, One Ranger, which details the life and career of a legendary Texas Ranger along the volatile Texas/Mexico border.  Allen maintains residences in Los Angeles and his hometown of Austin, Texas. Flight crews on Southwest Airlines love him.</biographie>

            <biographie>Walton Goggins received an Emmy® nomination and two Broadcast Television Journalists Association (BTJA) nominations for Best Supporting Actor for his role as 'Boyd Crowder' on FX's Peabody Award-winning Drama series Justified.  Goggins reprised his turn as the transgender escort 'Venus Van Dam' (a play on his character Shane's alias of 'Cletus Van Damme' on The Shield) on the highly-rated FX drama series Sons of Anarchy. The role reunites Goggins with series creator Kurt Sutter who was also a writer on The Shield.  Goggins completed production on writer/director William Monahan's Mojave with Garrett Hedlund and Oscar Issacs. He plays 'Jim,' an entertainment lawyer experiencing an existential crisis. He has also completed production on writer/director Ross Clarke's adaptation of Craig Clevenger's novel Dermaphoria. Goggins plays 'Eliah Blanc,' a wealthy New Orleanian whose pastimes include the funding of meth labs.  Goggins has had pivotal roles in films by two of Hollywood's most important auteurs: Quentin Tarantino, in Django Unchained; and Steven Spielberg in Lincoln. He also appeared in such diverse films as G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra, Robert Rodriguez's Predators and Machete Kills, Jon Favreau's Cowboys &amp; Aliens, and Rod Lurie's Straw Dogs.  Goggins previously garnered much acclaim for his complex and edgy portrayal of 'Detective Shane Vendrell' on FX's gritty, award-winning drama series The Shield. In 2009, he was nominated for a Television Critics Association (TCA) Award in the category of "Individual Achievement in Drama."  In the last ten years, Goggins has also taken his turn behind the camera. He recently collaborated with writer Adam Fierro ("The Shield") on the pilot "Gringo" which sold to FOX. Goggins' prior collaborations with his partners at Ginny Mule Pictures include winning an Academy Award® for their short film, The Accountant, which he produced and starred in. The team produced, directed and starred in their first feature, Chrystal, starring Billy Bob Thornton, which was accepted into the 2005 Sundance Film Festival's Dramatic Competition. For their third collaboration, Goggins produced and starred in the feature Randy and the Mob, which won the Audience Award for Best Feature at the 2007 Nashville Film Festival.  Goggins and his Ginny Mule partners completed their fourth feature, That Evening Sun, starring Hal Holbrook and Goggins. The film made its world premiere at the South By Southwest (SXSW) Film Festival in Austin, TX in March 2009, where it won the Narrative Feature Audience Award and received the Special Jury Award for "Best Ensemble Cast." The film continued winning awards at over 14 film festivals, culminating with the honor of the "Wyatt Award" from the Southeastern Film Critics Association (SEFCA) and two Independent Spirit Award nominations.  Goggins also takes time to lend a hand to various non-profit organizations and has joined forces with City Hearts, whose focus is bringing the arts to underfunded schools. He has also worked closely with Global Green USA, which is committed to sustainable development and the legislation to support it.  He enjoys traveling the world and has spent time in Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Central America, Morocco and India last spring. Goggins is an avid photographer and has captured many of his journeys on film.</biographie>

            <biographie>J.D. was born in the delta town of Greenville, Mississippi (also the birthplace of Muppets creator Jim Henson) on the same day Richard Nixon was elected president. He is of Irish-French-German-Cherokee-Choctaw decent, the oldest of 7 siblings, and attended 17 different schools (public and private) while moving back and forth between his mother and father. His great-great-great-great uncle was Horace Mann, the founder of the American Public School system. His father (Puddin - yep, that's what they call him) is a welder/artist/amateur archaeologist and inventor. His mother (Sally) has had many professions, including concert promoter and owner of a country/western nightclub called The Headless Horseman, where as a young child, J.D. spent many school nights until the wee hours of the morning hanging out backstage and on stage with the likes of Hank Williams, Jr., Juice Newton, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Paycheck, David Allen Coe, Ray Price, and many others.  After a short stint in college and a 15 month stint in the Marine Corps stationed at 29 Palms, California and after hanging out with some actors in L.A., J.D. thought he would give acting a shot. His only experience with acting had been playing the Prince in his pre-school production of The Nutcracker, and getting kicked out of his senior play, Oklahoma, after his second rehearsal because he and a friend drank a beer before hand. After the Marine Corps, he returned to Mississippi and worked as a debt collector for his mother's collection agency. After a year of hating his job, he decided to return to college and get a degree in theatre at The University of Southern Mississippi. Once on stage at college, he knew acting was what he had to do. His second year in theatre, he was one of 20 finalists in the state selected to attend SETC (Southeastern Theatre Conference). In 1995, a friend offered J.D. a $1,000 to come to Los Angeles and perform a lead role in his play "Dylan's Ghost" at the Morgan-Wixson Theatre in Santa Monica. J.D. took him up on the offer and left college a semester before graduating and since then has lived back and forth between Hollywood, California, Austin, Texas, and Oxford, Mississippi, where he just completed writing and directing his first independent feature _Glorious Mail(2005)_.  Even though he appeared on the short-lived game show, Hollywood Showdown with Todd Newton and won nearly $12,000, his friends like to tell him that he's almost one lucky son of a gun. Mainly because he's come so close to landing lead roles in major films so many times, usually being the director's second choice. In 2004 his luck proved true once again when he purchased a $100 raffle ticket and was 1st Runner Up (2nd Choice) for a $250,000 house in United Way's New Home Giveaway, where instead he won an artist's print worth $80.</biographie>

She continued her studies participating in a five week program studying acting in affiliation with NYU. That summer, Dana saw Shakespeare in the Park's Twelfth Night, which inspired her. At the end of the program and with no place to live, Dana made the bold decision to stay in New York. Eventually she found a tiny studio in Spanish Harlem, waited tables, auditioned, gigged, did background vocals, and even taught theater at a community center in Brooklyn. Dana has performed and also produced original work at: The Red Room Theater, Birdland, Lennox Lounge, Alvin Ailey Citigroup Theater, Under St. Mark's, The Cherry Lane Theater, Summer Stages in Central Park, and La Mama Theater. At La Mama Theater, Dana was apart of a project called Soulagraphie: a series of plays about genocide written by renowned playwright Eric Ehn. She played the title character Maria Kizito: a play about a Rwandan Nun that was tried and convicted of aiding in the death of thousands.  In 2010, Dana completed her MFA in Acting from the reputable California Institute of the Arts, where she was in two world premieres and a long list of other full theatrical productions both Classic and Contemporary. Upon graduating, she came straight home and broke into Hollywood South, as Film and Television were also her great loves. Dana had one goal when deciding to move back home; it was to be on HBO's Treme; the David Simon executively produced show about her hometown. Not only was she on it, but she landed a recurring role.  Since then Dana has worked with some of Hollywood's biggest Academy Award Winners and Nominees. It all began when she landed the role of Cora in Winner Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained. She felt so welcomed and connected to Quentin. She pitched ideas about her character to him, including a song for the funeral scene, which was shot, but would eventually land on the cutting room floor. Her next endeavor was working with Nominee Lee Daniels' on his film, The Butler. She portrayed the role of Helen Holloway, wife of James Holloway, played by Lenny Kravitz.  Additionally, Dana has worked directly with Academy Award Winners and Nominees: Angela Bassett, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Woody Harrelson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jessica Lang, Christoph Waltz, Forest Whitaker, and Oprah Winfrey!  Dana considers herself Tri-Costal, but currently resides in New Orleans, which will always be home.</biographie>

            <biographie>Jamie's mother, Louise, was an adopted child. When her marriage to his father failed, his grandparents, Mark and Estelle Talley, stepped in and, at age 7 months, adopted him too. He says he had a very rigid upbringing that placed him in the Boy Scouts and the church choir. During high school, he played quarterback for his high school team and was good enough that he got press in Dallas newspapers. He studied music in college. He released a music album in 1994, "Peep This" and sings the theme song for his 1999 movie, _Any Given Sunday (1999)_ (qv). However, in 1989, his life changed when a girl friend challenged him to get up onstage at the Comedy Club. In fact, he says he took his androgynous stage name because he learned that women got preference for mike time on open stage nights. That led to his being cast in _"Roc" (1991)_ (qv) and _"In Living Color" (1990)_ (qv) and ultimately to his own WB network TV series. He has a daughter, Corrine, born in 1995, who lives with her mother.</biographie>

            <dateNaissance>1936-06-04T12:00:00</dateNaissance>
            <biographie>Bruce Dern had established himself as the movies' premier heavy, playing sociopaths, psychotics and just plain criminals by the time he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for _Coming Home (1978)_ (qv). Some perceptive critics had noted that Dern was a finer actor than his roles generally allowed one to believe, repelled as one was by the neurotic persona that Dern was able to project and that casting directors capitalized on.  'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), a close friend, claimed that Dern was the best of the new breed of actors who had been born just before World War II and were coming into their own in the 1970s. Unlike his screen image, Dern had come from a patrician background: his grandfather had been governor of Utah and a secretary of war under 'Franklin D. Roosevelt' (qv). When allowed to step out of his on-screen persona to assay the millionaire Tom Buchanan in the 1974 remake of _The Great Gatsby (1974)_ (qv), he acquitted himself quite well.  Some critics said that "Gatsby" would have been better if Dern rather than 'Robert Redford (I)' (qv) had played the title role. Others pointed to his fine work as Nicholson's brother in _The King of Marvin Gardens (1972)_ (qv) to establish a case that he was an underappreciated and underutilized talent. By the time Dern appeared as the cuckolded Marine in "Coming Home," a consensus had emerged that Dern was a fine actor. He won an Oscar nod for the role, then fell victim to the infamous "Oscar curse" that has claimed other winners, most famously in the case of 1969 Best Supporting Actor winner 'Gig Young' (qv), Dern's co-star in _They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969)_ (qv).  Dern, like Young before him, was determined to break out of supporting roles. Like Young, who had been cast repeatedly as a light comedian in his career, Dern had also become typecast, but as a psycho, surpassing even 'Anthony Perkins (I)' (qv) in those types of roles. Dern was determined to break out of the ghetto he had found himself in before "Coming Home." He failed, and his career suffered.  Up through his Oscar nomination, Dern had starred in 26 films in 11 years since graduating to steady employment in A-pictures with _Waterhole #3 (1967)_ (qv). After the 1979 Oscar nod, he would appear in only a dozen feature films in the next 11 years, not counting TV movies. None of them brought him stardom or much acclaim, and his attempt at becoming a lead man, _Middle Age Crazy (1980)_ (qv), flopped badly (he did received a nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actor at the 1981 Genie Awards, the Canadian equivalent of the Oscars, for his work in that picture). It was back to psychos, this time as a lead, in _Tattoo (1981)_ (qv). The movie proved to be another flop, and his reputation was further damaged when he bragged that he had actually performed on-screen sexual intercourse with co-star 'Maud Adams' (qv), a boast that Adams heatedly denied. Dern's star was seriously dimmed.  Although he landed a coveted role in the film adaptation of 'Jason Miller (I)' (qv)'s Pulitzer Prize-winning play _That Championship Season (1982)_ (qv), the film was a disappointment with critics and at the box office. He turned in a fine performance three years later in the TV movie _Toughlove (1985) (TV)_ (qv), but overall, his career was floundering.  Another psycho role, that of Uncle Bud in _After Dark, My Sweet (1990)_ (qv), started buzz about another possible Best Supporting Oscar nod for him, but the film proved a box-office bust and the nomination never materialized. A predicted career renaissance for Dern faded, just as the careers of his ex-wife, 'Diane Ladd' (qv), and their daughter, 'Laura Dern' (qv), kicked into high gear.  Since the 1990 high point of the second wave of his career, Dern has stayed steadily employed, but has never again generated much critical acclaim, nor made any inroads towards reclaiming his crown as the cinema's premier sociopath. A fine actor, who will be remembered most vividly for such psycho/killer roles such as the rustler leader who gunned down 'John Wayne (I)' (qv) in _The Cowboys (1972)_ (qv), Dern's career serves as a cautionary tale for those actors who try to escape the ghetto of typecasting. While nothing restricts an actor's artistic development as much as typecasting, unless like a Duke Wayne they can turn that type into superstardom, trying to break out of the type can prove to be career suicide.</biographie>

            <biographie>He's the son of Vaudeville great, 'Clarence Stroud' (qv), of the Stroud Twins and singer 'Ann McCormack (I)' (qv), who toured the world with 'Frank Sinatra' (qv).  Don grew up on the beach in Honolulu, Hawaii, where his stepfather, 'Paul Livermore' (qv), and his mother, Ann, owned and operated the popular "Embers Steak House" and nightclub where Ann performed nightly. Don thrived on the beach in Waikiki under the watchful eyes of such mentors as Blackout, Mud, Buckshot, Rabbit and Steamboat. He learned much from these famous beach boys and in 1960, at the age of 17, he placed fourth in the "Duke Kahanamoku World Surfing Championship" at Makaha, Hawaii. Don was surfing at Waikiki when he was discovered. Actor 'Troy Donahue' (qv) was filming _"Hawaiian Eye" (1959)_ (qv) and needed a stunt double for his surfing scenes. Don, at 18, 6' 2" and 175 pounds, stepped up and was hired on the spot. He loved the gig so much, he decided to go to Hollywood to give it a try. Upon arriving in L.A., he landed a variety of jobs, including parking cars, bouncer and then manager of the world famous "Whiskey A Go-Go" nightclub on the Sunset Strip, where such greats as 'Janis Joplin' (qv), 'Jimi Hendrix' (qv) and 'Jim Morrison (I)' (qv) of the "Doors" appeared. It was at the "Whiskey" that actor 'Sidney Poitier' (qv) turned Don on to his acting career. Don went on to become one of Hollywood's great heavies and character actors. He has starred in over 100 movies and 175 television shows to date. He has also starred in four television series, notably 'Mickey Spillane' (qv)'s _"Mike Hammer" (1984)_ (qv) with 'Stacy Keach' (qv) and _"The New Gidget" (1986)_ (qv) where he was a natural to play the "Kahuna".</biographie>

            <dateNaissance>1951-09-09T12:00:00</dateNaissance>
            <biographie>He'll forever be remembered as strapping, good ol' boy Luke Duke, the virile, blue-eyed, dark-haired, plaid-shirted rascal (equally good-looking 'John Schneider (I)' (qv) was the strapping, plaid-shirted blond cousin) on the rough-and-tumble bucolic 80s series _"The Dukes of Hazzard" (1979)_ (qv). Where others may have fallen by the TV wayside, however, after the cancellation of such a popular series, Wopat moved on and reverted back to his first true love - music - successfully refocusing as a recording artist and musical leading man of Broadway and regional shows.  The highly engaging Wisconsin native was born one of six brothers and sisters to a dairy farmer in 1951. Tom began singing and dancing in school musicals from age 12 and, following high school graduation, decided to avidly pursue music as a viable profession. Studying at the University of Wisconsin he dropped out to front a rock band as both guitarist and lead singer, and later gained on-stage experience in such musicals as "South Pacific", "West Side Story" and "Jesus Christ Superstar".  Appearing off-Broadway in 1978 before making his Broadway debut that same year as a replacement actor in the musical "I Love My Wife", other book shows came his way including "The Robber Bridegroom" and the lead in "Oklahoma!" With solid, down-home good looks and appeal, it didn't take long for Hollywood to check him out. By 1979 Tom was co-starring in (and later sometimes directing) episodes of his own popular action-packed series while he and Schneider wrangled heartthrob status in the teen magazines. The backwoods show lasted six seasons, although at one point he and Schneider left the series after contract negotiations broke down. Briefly replaced, the show wasn't the same without them and they eventually were brought back. During the show's run, Tom kick-started his recording career with his first (and self-titled) country album release in 1983. His output went on to include six other country albums before finally releasing a 2000 album of standard love songs.  After the end of his series, Wopat made do in a couple of mini-movie vehicles and a few short-lived series before scoring again on TV as 'Cybill Shepherd' (qv)' ex-husband/stuntman on her own sitcom series in 1995. Better yet, he resharpened his musical theater skills. He returned with commanding baritone leads in "Carousel" (1986), "City of Angels" (1990) and "Guys and Dolls" (1992) (as Skye Masterson). In 1999 he recreated the sharp-shooting Frank Butler role opposite 'Bernadette Peters' (qv) in the popular Broadway revival of "Annie Get Your Gun" and earned a Tony nomination in the process.  It's only gotten sweeter. Guesting for the Cincinnati Symphony and Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestras in programs featuring Broadway's finest music, he has continued on the New York stage with successive roles in "42nd Street" and "Chicago" (as slick lawyer Billy Flynn). In 2005 he more than held his own in his first straight-acting Broadway part as part of the excellent ensemble in the Tony-winning (for "Best Revival of a Play") production of "Glengarry Glen Ross" starring acting heavyweights 'Alan Alda' (qv) and 'Liev Schreiber' (qv). That same year Wopat embarked on a 33-date national "Over The Rainbow" tour with 'Faith Prince' (qv) featuring the gorgeous songs of 'Harold Arlen' (qv), a tour that included Carnegie Hall.</biographie>

            <biographie>Pittsburgh-born actor/SFX wizard/stuntman/director Tom Savini did a tour of duty as a combat cameraman in Vietnam, and has since acquired a remarkable cult following among film fans, primarily due to his ground-breaking SFX in the "splatter movie" explosion of the early 1980s. Along with fellow special make-up legends 'Dick Smith (II)' (qv) and 'Rob Bottin' (qv), Savini was one of the key SFX people behind the startling make-up &amp; EFX seen in the fantasy/horror genre films of the 1980s-'90s. Savini was heavily influenced by the remarkable silent-era actor 'Lon Chaney' (qv), and he sought to emulate the amazing theatrical make-up effects that were a hallmark of Chaney's career. In Savini's insightful book "Grande Illusions", he speaks of his early attempts at applying prosthetics to his face using "spearmint gum", having misinterpreted that he was meant to actually use "spirit gum"!  His first work was in low-budget fare, providing SFX and make-up for independently made horror films such as _Deranged (1974)_ (qv) and _Martin (1976)_ (qv). However, he really caught the attention of horror buffs with his grisly effects in the cult 'George A. Romero (I)' (qv)-directed zombie film _Dawn of the Dead (1978)_ (qv), and then in the controversial slasher film _Friday the 13th (1980)_ (qv), the movie generally identified as the kickstart for the aforementioned "splatter movie" genre. Savini also contributed the incredible EFX &amp; make-up to other splatter thrillers such as _Maniac (1980)_ (qv), _The Burning (1981)_ (qv), _Creepshow (1982)_ (qv) and Romero's third "Dead" film, _Day of the Dead (1985)_ (qv) (for which he won a Saturn Award).  In 1990, Savini directed his feature film debut _Night of the Living Dead (1990)_ (qv), the remake of the original zombie-classic. Not content with just being behind the lens, however, Savini has appeared in dozens of films, and can be seen demonstrating his capable acting skills as "Morgan, the Black Knight" in _Knightriders (1981)_ (qv), as "Blades", one of the biker gang members in _Dawn of the Dead (1978)_ (qv) and as "Sex Machine", another leather-clad biker--but this time with a groin-mounted gun--in the wild vampire film _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv).</biographie>

            <biographie>Russ Tamblyn might as well face it...he will be a Jet "till his last dying day." Indelibly linked to the "womb to tomb" role of Riff, the knife-wielding, rocket-tempered, Baryshnikov-styled gang leader of the streetwise Jets in the musical film masterpiece _West Side Story (1961)_ (qv), it's not a bad way to be remembered! Russ was actually 27 when he portrayed the teenage troublemaker who became the '50s equivalent of the Mercutio character in the Romeo and Juliet-inspired adaptation.  To describe Tamblyn as talented and extremely agile is a huge understatement. This awesome musical performer was born in Los Angeles, California on December 30, 1934, and groomed early for stardom. Discovered at age ten by actor 'Lloyd Bridges (I)' (qv) for the play "Stone Jungle", Russ was soon performing on radio and in L.A.-based musical revues. Billed as "Rusty Tamblyn" then, the tousle-haired scrapper played a student extra in his first film _The Boy with Green Hair (1948)_ (qv) starring another child actor, 'Dean Stockwell' (qv). Having taken up dancing and acrobatics from the age of 6, Tamblyn marked his abilities with his very first TV appearance on the "The Ed Sullivan Show." Eventually handed a starring role in the "B" film _The Kid from Cleveland (1949)_ (qv), he was signed by an eager MGM who saw his potential as a juvenile actor. Featured in the popular family-oriented comedy _Father of the Bride (1950)_ (qv), and its sequel _Father's Little Dividend (1951)_ (qv), Tamblyn also had a prime role in the war drama _Take the High Ground! (1953)_ (qv) before taking off in musical films. Demonstrating exceptional athleticism in one of MGM's best, _Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954)_ (qv), Tamblyn's timing was regrettably off as musicals were quickly on the wane. He adjusted, however. A starring role in the low-budget _The Young Guns (1956)_ (qv) led to excellent reviews in the ensemble box-office soaper _Peyton Place (1957)_ (qv). Tamblyn, along with 'Lana Turner' (qv), 'Arthur Kennedy (I)' (qv), 'Hope Lange' (qv) and 'Diane Varsi' (qv), all received Oscar nominations for their participation. Russ scored quite well in the title role of _tom thumb (1958)_ (qv), which became a large stepping stone in his being cast as Riff in 1961. Following this achievement, however, the offers started dwindling.  Tamblyn's last co-starring roles in quality films were shot overseas with the British-produced chiller _The Haunting (1963)_ (qv) with 'Julie Harris (I)' (qv) and 'Claire Bloom (I)' (qv), and the British-Yugoslavian Viking costumer _The Long Ships (1964)_ (qv) starring 'Richard Widmark' (qv) and 'Sidney Poitier' (qv). After that, his career grew quite dismal. Titles such as _The Female Bunch (1971)_ (qv), _Satan's Sadists (1969)_ (qv), _Scream Free! (1969)_ (qv), _Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1971)_ (qv) and _Blood Screams (1990)_ (qv) pretty much tells the story. On the road in the lean years with minor stage productions here and there, including the musical "Cabaret," Russ all but disappeared from the viewing audience. When he finally nabbed the role of the overtly weird (and who wasn't on that show?) psychiatrist Dr. Lawrence Jacoby in the popular TV cult series _"Twin Peaks" (1990)_ (qv), it was the first time Tamblyn had generated interest in over two decades. Barely recognizable with his wild-eyed look, mangy hair and frizzy beard, he has since gained employment off this eccentric image. Married three times, Tamblyn has lately taken on choreographic duties and the managing of actress/daughter 'Amber Tamblyn' (qv)'s career, she of _"Joan of Arcadia" (2003)_ (qv) fame.</biographie>

            <biographie>William Hudson, an American actor from Chicago, is the son of Michael Hudson, a popular radio disc jockey on Chicago's number one urban station, WGCI 107.5. William attended St. Ignatius high school on West Roosevelt Rd. and played varsity basketball for the Wolfpack. His love and talent for the game ended him up at The University of Miami with the Hurricanes, however after just one year he decided to focus on entertainment instead.  While on a trip to New York City in the summer of 2007 visiting friends of the family, Hudson found himself in the borough of Brooklyn at the exact same time as the academy award winning director, Ridley Scott was filming the 1970's based major motion picture, "American Gangster." Wearing his hair braided in cornrows at the time, Hudson decided to take them out and approach Mr. Scott with his own 70's style afro and ambition. Seeing the determination in Mr. Hudson's eyes and the hairstyle befitting of the period piece, Ridley decided to include William in the film as a drug dealer alongside fellow Chicago native and actor, "Common Sense."  With the successful major motion picture, "American Gangster" under his belt, Mr. Hudson then found himself in Los Angeles, California on an audition for another period piece to be directed by yet another academy award winning director, Quentin Tarantino. The movie was "Django Unchained," and the role was that of the character named, "Blueberry," a slave turned killer deep in the woods of Texas in the year 1861. "Django Unchained" went on the be Mr. Tarantino's highest grossing film to date.  Mr. Hudson still lives in Chicago Illinois.</biographie>

            <biographie>As an established and extremely talented stunt double, Zoe Bell has made a name for herself through her unparalleled dedication, skills, and focus. Bell debuts her acting career, with her already famous stunt skills, in the highly anticipated double feature _Grindhouse (2007)_ (qv) written by 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv) and 'Robert Rodriguez (I)' (qv). She was hand picked, by Tarentino himself, to star in his segment of the double feature, Death Proof, about four women working on the movie set of their next big hit. All seems to be going well on set until a psychotic killer begins to stalk them.  Bell began working with Tarantino well before Grindhouse hough, in _Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)_ (qv) and _Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)_ (qv) playing the stunt double for Uma Thurman's role, The Bride. Bell was nominated for her work in Kill Bill, Vol. 1 in the categories of Best Stunt by a Stunt Woman and Best Fight for the Taurus World Stunt Awards, both of which she would win the following year for Kill Bill: Vol. 2. Bell also showed off her stunt-woman skills as a double for Sharon Stone in Halle Barry's _Catwoman (2004)_ (qv).  Bell's talent can not only be seen on the big screen but also in the cult television series _"Xena: Warrior Princess" (1995)_ (qv) where she was the stunt double for Lucy Lawless. Bell also appeared as a double in the ABC thriller _"Alias" (2001)_ (qv) and on an episode of Cleopatra 2525 in 2000 as a double for Vicki Pratti.  In the action packed documentary _Double Dare (2004)_ (qv), Bell along with legendary stunt-woman 'Jeannie Epper' (qv) give an insight into the career of women who take falls and punches for a living. Double Dare also gives a glimpse into the struggles of stunt-women to stay thin, employed, and sane in a male dominated career.  Bell, a native of New Zealand, currently resides in Los Angeles but hopes to someday own a home in New Zealand.</biographie>

While in New York, Christoph met his first wife, and moved back to Vienna, then to London.  During the 80s, Christoph worked primarily in theater, commuting from his home in London to Germany. Slowly he began to work in TV, taking one-off roles on series, and TV movies. Film roles soon followed, however, attempts to break into English-speaking film and TV were unsuccessful.

It was not until he met Quentin Tarantino that his career in Hollywood took off. The role of Colonel Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds catapulted Christoph from a lifetime working in German TV/film to the new life of an international superstar, Academy Award winning actor.

            <biographie>Franco Nero, a leading actor in international cinema, was born in Parma (Northern Italy).  His inclination for acting had already become obvious in his teenage years when he began organizing and participating in student plays.  After a short stint at a leading theater school, he moved to Rome where he joined a small group of friends for the purpose of making some documentaries.  Still unsure of his ultimate vocation, he worked various jobs on the crew.  The role as Abel in John Houston's film "The Bible" marked a crucial point in his career.  A few months later he had his big break with the internationally acclaimed cult-classic Spaghetti-Western "Django". The following year Joshua Logan cast him in the film version of "Camelot" (Warner Bros.), opposite Vanessa Redgrave, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe award.  Nero has appeared in more than 195 movies around the world and has worked with Europe's top directors, such as Luis Bunuel, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Claude Chabrol, Sergei Bondarciuk, Michael Cacoyannis, Elio Petri, Marco Bellocchio, Enzo G. Castellari, just to mention a few. He has also payed the roles of leading national heroes, such as "Garibaldi" (Italy), "Arpad" (Hungary", "Banovic Strahinja" (Yugoslavia). In the USA he has been in successful mini-series such as "The Pirate" (Warner Bros), "The Last Days of Pompeii" (CBS), "Young Catherine" (TNT), "Bella Mafia" (CBS), "The Painted Lady", "Saint Augustine", and movies such as "The Legend of Valentino", "21 Hours to Munich", "Force 10 from Navarone", "Enter the Ninja", "The Versace Murder", "Die Hard 2", and recently "Letters to Juliet".  At the beginning of the 80's, he also began producing, writing and directing.  Between films, he participates in various theatrical events.  Over the last 45 years he has been a benefactor of the Don Bosco orphanage in Tivoli.  He has received many awards and in 1992 for his artistic merits a knighthood of the Italian Republic was bestowed on him by the President of Italy.  In 2011 he was honored by Brunel University of London with the honorary degree of doctor of Letters honoris causa and in Toronto with a star on the walk of fame.</biographie>

            <biographie>Escalante Lundy is an American film and television actor and producer, from New Orleans, LA. His most notable role is as "Big Fred" in Quentin Tarantino's Oscar-Nominated film, Django Unchained. Lundy also appears as a prison guard in HBO's Emmy-Nominated television series Treme and in a Pampers commercial with Super Bowl Championship Quarterback, New Orleans Saints' Drew Brees.  Escalante Lundy was born in New Orleans, LA the eldest of five brothers, to Merline (nee' Roy), retired real estate agent, of Rayne, LA, and Hughes Banks Lundy, a salesman from Innis, LA. Lundy graduated from St. Augustine High School, later receiving his Bachelor's degree in Urban Planning from the University of Southwestern Louisiana (USL). Lundy received Masters degrees in Urban Planning and Geographic Information Systems from the University of New Orleans.  Escalante's career began as a stage producer in Sacramento, CA. When an actor failed to show-up, Lundy took the role', garnered success and later decided to focus on acting as a career path. Admittedly, shy by nature, Lundy used acting as a tool to face his fears of public speaking and improve his diction. He continued to hone his acting skills by taking parts in small productions in film and on-stage in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.  Lundy returned to New Orleans in 2005, leaving his position with the California Department of Transportation in Sacramento. Lundy's family members were victims of Hurricane Katrina and his valiant character motivated him to permanently relocate. As the city began to rebuild, Lundy continued to pursue his new found acting passions including focusing on film roles. He studied with renowned acting coaches Veleka Grey (Young and the Restless), Lance Nichols (Curious Case of Benjamin Button and HBO Television Series, Treme) and became a fixture at the acclaimed Jerry Katz Joint (Ivana Chubback Technique). In 2007, Lundy joined the made his New Orleans theatrical debut as co-lead in the production of the "Papaya Man" with the Anthony Bean Community Theater (ABCT)in New Orleans. After having a challenging first rehearsal Lundy says, "I tried to quit but Mr. Bean wouldn't let me. He gave me legs until I was able to run"  In 2012, Lundy made his major motion picture debut as "Big Fred" in Quentin Tarantino's spaghetti western, Django Unchained. Lundy's role as a Mandingo fighter reflects the contrast of the powerlessness of slavery against the super human strength it took to survive such atrocities. Additionally, the grueling fight scenes Lundy appears in are riveting. Although filming the scenes was long and arduous, the efforts paid off. Tarantino directed Lundy in some of the most memorable aspects of the film.</biographie>

            <biographie>Best known for his starring role as Det. Sonny Crockett on the hugely successful TV series _"Miami Vice" (1984)_ (qv), Don Johnson is one of the stars who really defined the 1980s. As James "Sonny" Crockett he went toe-to-toe with drug dealers, pimps, prostitutes, assassins, illegal arms-dealers and crooked cops on a weekly basis from 1984 to 1989, appearing in a grand total of 110 episodes. The show, which was executive-produced by four time Oscar-nominated director, producer and writer 'Michael Mann (I)' (qv), paired Johnson with the equally cool 'Philip Michael Thomas' (qv) as Det. Ricardo Tubbs and the calm and stoic presence of 'Edward James Olmos' (qv) as Lt. Martin Castillo. It revolutionized television with its modern fashion, pop music, unique style and use of real locations. Johnson typically wore $1000 Armani, Versace and Hugo Boss suits over pastel cotton T-shirts, drove a Ferrari 365 GTS/4 Daytona (later a Ferrari Testarossa) and lived on an Endeavour 42-foot sailboat named "St. Vitus' Dance" with his pet alligator Elvis. He also had full use of an offshore powerboat. Still, "Miami Vice" had not only style but substance, and his portrayal of the Vietnam veteran turned vice detective turned Sonny Crockett into the world's favorite cop. For his work on "Miami Vice" Johnson won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series in 1986, and was nominated in the same category a year later. He also picked up an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1985.  Johnson was born in Flat Creek, Missouri, the son of a farmer and a beautician. As a kid he wanted to become a professional bowler. Later, after a few brushes with the law at a young age, he discovered acting. After working on the stage for a while he ventured into films and television, but was not able to break into stardom despite, among other things, starring in the sci-fi cult classic _A Boy and His Dog (1975)_ (qv). During the late 1960s and early 70s, Johnson had two short-lived marriages that were annulled; the names of his first two wives have never been made public. 'Tippi Hedren' (qv), Johnson's co-star in _The Harrad Experiment (1973)_ (qv), allowed him to date her daughter 'Melanie Griffith' (qv) despite the fact that she was only 14 and he was 22; the relationship culminated in a six-month marriage during 1976. In the 1980s he lived with actress 'Patti D'Arbanville' (qv) and they had one son together. He remarried Griffith in 1989, but divorced in 1996 when she left him for 'Antonio Banderas' (qv). Johnson has been married to fifth wife Kelly Phleger since 1999, and they have three children together.  Johnson starred in four failed TV pilots before landing his career-high role on "Miami Vice", which propelled him to superstardom. He directed four highly praised episodes of the show, one of them co-starring Melanie Griffith. He balanced his work on the series by appearing in the critically acclaimed TV film _The Long Hot Summer (1985) (TV)_ (qv), an adaptation of the 'William Faulkner (I)' (qv) novel, and the film _Sweet Hearts Dance (1988)_ (qv) with 'Susan Sarandon' (qv). After the series ended he focused solely on his film career. Although movies like _Dead Bang (1989)_ (qv), _The Hot Spot (1990)_ (qv) and _Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991)_ (qv) did not fare well with the critics, quite a few of them have obtained a considerable cult following, with fans praising them as all being quality contributions to their genre. His film work has given Johnson the opportunity to work with legendary filmmakers like 'John Frankenheimer' (qv), 'Sidney Lumet' (qv) and 'Dennis Hopper' (qv).  After working steadily, Johnson returned to TV in 1996 with the cop show _"Nash Bridges" (1996)_ (qv). The show, which Johnson created and produced, did very well. It co-starred 'Cheech Marin' (qv) and 'Jodi Lyn O'Keefe' (qv). Johnson played the title role, a captain in the San Francisco PD's Special Investigations Unit. He was again paired with a flashy vehicle, this time an electric-yellow 1971 Plymouth Barracuda convertible. After "Nash Bridges" went off the air Johnson kept a low profile, but continues to appear in films and on television. He starred in the failed WB courtroom drama _"Just Legal" (2005)_ (qv), which was produced by 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv), and has traveled to Europe to make such films as the Norwegian screwball comedy _Lange flate ballær II (2008)_ (qv) and the Italian films _Bastardi (2008)_ (qv) and _Torno a vivere da solo (2008)_ (qv). He will soon be seen in the romantic comedy _When in Rome (2010)_ (qv) with 'Anjelica Huston' (qv) and 'Danny DeVito' (qv), as well as the indie comedy _A Good Old Fashioned Orgy (2011)_ (qv). 'Don Johnson (I)' starred in the 2007 feature film, _"Moondance Alexander" (2007)_, along with 'Lori Loughlin' (qv), 'Kay Panabaker' (qv), 'James Best (I)' (qv), 'Sasha Cohen (I)' (qv), and 'Whitney Sloan' (qv).</biographie>

            <biographie>A Manhattan-born character player who attended New York University, actor James Russo wrote and starred in a prize-winning short film, "The Candy Store", while attending college. His first big film break was as a convenience store robber in _Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)_ (qv). Possessed with a stare that can bring shivers down one's back, he has been quite the accessible villain over the years, memorably portraying a number of gritty psychopaths and gangsters, among other undesirables. Surprisingly, Russo is not a name or commodity, yet an intense and dependable "tough guy" performer he has proven to be. One only needs to be reminded of his sadistic sexual animal role in "Extremities" on stage (in which he won a 1983 Theatre World) and in film (in which he terrorized 'Farrah Fawcett' (qv)), to recall how chillingly effective he can be. Other decent roles in films include 'Kevin Costner' (qv)'s _The Postman (1997)_ (qv) and _Open Range (2003)_ (qv), plus _Beverly Hills Cop (1984)_ (qv), _We're No Angels (1989)_ (qv), _Donnie Brasco (1997)_ (qv), _No Way Home (1996)_ (qv), and a number of low-budget crimers. On stage, he has "Welcome to Andromeda", "Deathwatch", "Marat/Sade" and the afore-mentioned "Extremities" to his credit. Russo appeared opposite 'Johnny Depp' (qv) in 'Roman Polanski' (qv)'s _The Ninth Gate (1999)_ (qv), and portrayed mobster "Victor Mura" in TV's short-lived, _"Falcone" (2000)_ (qv), the following year. More recently, he offered a penetrating cameo as 'Frank Sinatra' (qv) in _Stealing Sinatra (2003)_ (qv).</biographie>

            <biographie>In January of 1992, _Reservoir Dogs (1992)_ (qv) appeared at the Sundance Film Festival, by first-time writer-director Quentin Tarantino. The film garnered critical acclaim and the director became a legend immediately. Two years later, he followed up Dogs success with _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv) which premiered at the Cannes film festival, winning the coveted Palme D'Or Award. At the 1995 Academy Awards, it was nominated for the best picture, best director and best original screenplay. Tarantino and writing partner 'Roger Avary' (qv) came away with the award only for best original screenplay. In 1995, Tarantino directed one fourth of the anthology _Four Rooms (1995)_ (qv) with friends and fellow auteurs 'Alexandre Rockwell' (qv), 'Robert Rodriguez (I)' (qv) and 'Allison Anders' (qv). The film opened on December 25th in the United States to very weak reviews. Tarantino's next film was _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv), a vampire/crime story which he wrote and co-starred with 'George Clooney' (qv). The film did fairly well theatrically.</biographie>

            <biographie>Few actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio's. DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom _"Growing Pains" (1985)_ (qv) and low budget horror movies, such as _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) and _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as 'Martin Scorsese' (qv) and 'Christopher Nolan (I)' (qv). But such a rich, varied career is what you would expect from someone who has had such an unusual upbring as DiCaprio.  Leonardo DiCaprio is the only child of former comic book artist 'George DiCaprio (I)' (qv) and 'Irmelin DiCaprio' (qv) (both born 1943). Leonardo's father, George, had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late 'Harvey Pekar', a friend of George's. However, Leonardo's performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name "Lenny Williams", DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs. DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in bit part roles in a number of television series, such as _"Roseanne" (1988)_ (qv) and _"The New Lassie" (1989)_ (qv), but it wasn't until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv), a low-budget horror movie.  While _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv) did little to help showcase DiCaprio's acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom _"Growing Pains" (1985)_ (qv), in which Leonardo was cast in the "Cousin Oliver" role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio's stint on _"Growing Pains" (1985)_ (qv) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public's attention and, after the show ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops. Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in _What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)_ (qv), a young gunslinger in _The Quick and the Dead (1995)_ (qv) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, "Jim Carroll", in _The Basketball Diaries (1995)_ (qv), a role which the late 'River Phoenix' (qv) originally expressed interest in.  While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo's reputation as an actor, it wasn't until his role as "Romeo" in 'Baz Luhrmann' (qv)'s _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio's reputation as a teen heartthrob.  Following his work on _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in _The Man in the Iron Mask (1998/I)_ (qv) and the low-budget _The Beach (2000/I)_ (qv) being some of his few notable roles during this period. However, in 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv) and _Gangs of New York (2002)_ (qv), his first of many collaborations with director 'Martin Scorsese' (qv).  With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment.  As someone who has gone from bit parts in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continues to defy conventions about the types of roles he will accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all star casts in action thrillers such as _The Departed (2006)_ (qv), _Shutter Island (2010)_ (qv) and 'Christopher Nolan (I)' (qv)'s _Inception (2010)_ (qv), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any cliché about actors. DiCaprio is not merely a former teen heartthrob turned leading man, he is one of the most respected, daring and challenging actors working today.</biographie>

      <synopsis>1986 - Soviet Russia has been arming international terrorists with chemical weapon technology, and a chemical weapons plant in the mountains is the target of James Bond and his closest compatriot, Alec Trevelyan. Infiltrating the compound, they are spotted and Alec is captured. When a ruthless Soviet officer, Oromov, executes Trevelyan, James pulls off a spectacular escape and succeeds in blowing up the compound. Now in 1995, he is assigned to tail former Red Air Force jet jockey Xenia Onatopp, who is working for a Russian crime syndicate known as Janus, but he is unable to stop her from stealing a powerful helicopter - a theft initially dismissed as a possibility by MI6's new leader, a woman who is a bureaucratic bean counter who, despite her acidic responses to grumbling from her ticked-off men, is having to learn her job as she goes, and who has to trust James Bond's instincts after a nuclear accident occurs over a Russian region housing the tracking station for a weapons satellite known as Goldeneye. James must track down the stolen gunship and all leads to a second Goldeneye system, and along the way he is horrified to find the true identity of the Janus syndicate, which leads to a spectacular running pursuit from the stolen gunship through a Soviet army prison to a wild street chase involving a tank and confrontation with a Soviet missile train, and eventually a showdown in the jungles of Cuba.</synopsis>

            <biographie>Desmond Llewelyn was born in South Wales in 1914, the son of a coal mining engineer. In high school, he worked as a stagehand in the school's productions and then picked up sporadic small parts. His family would not give up their effort to prevent him from a life on stage, so an uncle who was a high ranking police officer arranged for Llewelyn to take the department's physical exam. "Thank God, I flunked the eye test, and they wouldn't take me. I suspect the inspector had a hangover because he also failed this other chap I knew, who went out the same day and passed the physical for the Royal Navy, which had a lot tougher test." After failing the police exam, Llewelyn thought about becoming a minister, realizing after a week-long retreat of quiet and meditation that the ministry "was definitely not for me." Llewelyn persevered in his acting quest, and was accepted to the Royal Academy for the Dramatic Arts in the mid 1930s. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939, halted his acting career, and Llewelyn was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British army. He was assigned to the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and was sent to France in early 1940. In a short time, his regiment was fighting the Germans, and Llewelyn's company was holding off a division of German tanks. Llewelyn explained that "eventually, the tanks broke through and many of us jumped into this canal and started swimming down it to the other side, figuring that our chaps were still over there. But the Germans were the only ones there," and Llewelyn was captured, and held as a prisoner of war for five years. At one prison camp, the prisoners had dug a tunnel and were planning to escape the next morning. Llewelyn was down in the tunnel doing some maintenance work in preparation of the escape when the Germans found out about the tunnel and caught him down in it, a crime that earned Llewelyn 10 days in solitary, which Llewelyn called "a blessing of sorts. After spending every day of several years sleeping in a room with 50 other people, the quiet and privacy was rather nice." After the war, Llewelyn returned to London and revived his career, eventually being cast as his trademark Q in _From Russia with Love (1963)_ (qv). Since 1963, Llewelyn has appeared as Q in every Eon Productions Bond film, except _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Llewelyn was omitted from _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) because producers 'Harry Saltzman' (qv) and 'Albert R. Broccoli' (qv) felt that too much was being made of the gadgets and they would play it down. Llewelyn said he "was quite disappointed" at being left out of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Fans, however, missed Q, and Llewelyn got a call shortly after the release of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) telling him that he would be in the next Bond film, _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv). Llewelyn, who admits that his mechanical abilities in real life are virtually nil, is geared up for the next Bond movie. "I'd love to be in the next one," Llewelyn said. "Of course, if you consider my age, they should have put me out to grass a long time ago."</biographie>

She studied drama and music and, at 17, was discovered by a Swedish film director who cast her in the movie _Ingen kan älska som vi (1988)_ (qv), which made her a local teenage idol. She then became a successful model in Sweden and throughout Europe, where she made good use of her fluency in four languages.  In 1989, Scorupco displayed another facet of her talents, launching her career as a pop singer with her first single, Substitute. The single and subsequent album, IZA, both went gold, and she followed with another hit single, Shame, Shame, which she recorded in 1991. Returning to acting in 1994, she immediately won the lead role in the Swedish film _Petri tårar (1995)_ (qv). Scorupco stars as a woman who lives her life as a man in the medieval drama, which was released in August 1995.</biographie>

            <biographie>Robbie Coltrane, one of Britain's most popular comedians who was head of debating society at school and won prizes for his art, is now a film star who played in two James Bond films and in the "Harry Potter" franchise.  He was born Anthony Robert McMillan on March 30, 1950, in Rutherglen, a suburb of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. His father, Ian McMillan, was a general surgeon who also worked for police pathology. His mother, Jean, was a teacher and a pianist. Young Robbie was fond of art, music, films and cars. He was a voracious reader of his dad's books on medicine and crime. At age 12 he made his acting debut on stage at Glenalmond College, delivering rants from "Henry V". At that time he was fascinated with 'Marlon Brando' (qv) and 'Orson Welles' (qv).  He attended Glasgow Art School, majoring in drawing, painting and film, then studied art at Edinburgh's Moray House College of Education for a year. In 1973 he made a documentary titled "Young Mental Health", which was voted Film Of The Year by the Scottish Education Council. At that time Robbie took the name Coltrane, due to his love of jazz, and began a career of a stand-up comedian at night clubs, at the Edinburgh Festival, as well as an actor with Edinburgh's renowned Traverse Theatre.  In 1980 Coltrane made his debut on television as "Border Guard" in BBC's mini-series _"The Lost Tribe" (1980)_ (qv), then made his big screen debut as a limousine driver in _La mort en direct (1980)_ (qv). In 1981 he appeared in his first leading role as Detective Fritz Langley in _Subway Riders (1981)_ (qv), by famed underground director 'Amos Poe' (qv).  He became a well-known face through appearances in The Comic Strip series, then in _"Alfresco" (1983)_ (qv) and Comic Strip movies _The Supergrass (1985)_ (qv) and _The Pope Must Die (1991)_ (qv), among other films. At that time Coltrane had a drinking problem, downing as much as a bottle of whiskey a day. In 1986 he flew to a clinic in Mexico and was treated for obesity. In 1987 his partner for 15 years, Robin Paine, left him for good, leaving her portrait in Coltrane's barn.  In 1988 Coltrane met then 18-year-old Rhona Gemmell in a pub. They married and had a son, Spencer, and a daughter, Alice. His career took off during the early 1990s with the leading role as Dr. Eddie "Fitz" Fitzgerald, a forensic psychologist, in the popular TV series _"Cracker" (1993)_ (qv).  He made such a good performance as Valentin Zukovsky, a KGB man turned St. Petersburg mafia lord, in _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) the producers called him back for the same character in _The World Is Not Enough (1999)_ (qv). Then Coltrane hit another lucrative franchise; he was personally selected by 'J.K. Rowling' (qv) as her choice to play half-giant Rubeus Hagrid in the 'Harry Potter' films.  In early 1990s Coltrane wrote an autobiography, "Coltrane in a Cadillac", and also starred in the eponymous TV series, _"Coltrane in a Cadillac" (1993)_ (qv), in which he indulges his passion for vintage cars and tells with great humor about his 4000-mile journey across America from Los Angeles to New York. In 2003 he separated from his wife. His interests outside of his acting profession has been reading books, and rebuilding and collecting vintage cars. Robbie Coltrane resides in a converted farmhouse in Stirlingshire, Scotland, UK.</biographie>

            <biographie>Actor Simon Kunz was born on 8 May 1954, the same year that his American-born, England domiciled grandfather, the pianist Charlie Kunz, had a Top Twenty hit with Piano Medley 114. After leaving the Latymer School Simon read Theatre Studies at Warwick University and in 1984 became the drummer in the band the Locomotives. However, rather than follow Charlie into the music business he left the group after a year to concentrate on acting. On stage he appeared with the National Theatre (Brackenbury in 'Richard III'), the Oxford Stage Company (Oliver in 'As You Like It', Edgar in 'King Lear')in 'The Caretaker' at the Bristol Old Vic, 'Live Like Pigs' at the Royal Court and 'The Park' with the Royal Shakespeare Company, making his film debut in 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. On television he has appeared in most of the populist dramas where he seems to have played rather more than his fair share of policemen - of all ranks - and lawyers.</biographie>

            <biographie>Tall, broad shouldered character actor with Texan drawl first appeared in support in several Western vehicles both on TV and the cinema in the mid 1960s. Got himself noticed playing Steve McQueen's younger brother in _Junior Bonner (1972)_ (qv), and then scored the lead role of Buford Pusser (!) in the unexpected hit _Walking Tall (1973)_ (qv), an allegedly true tale about a Southern sheriff confronting corruption &amp; gangsters with a large wooden club and a mean attitude. Followed it up by playing a sadistic hit man called Molly, in Don Siegel's bank heist drama _Charley Varrick (1973)_ (qv). Joe Don Baker's next few films were rather forgettable until he landed the role of police detective Earl Eischied in _To Kill a Cop (1978) (TV)_ (qv)....which led him into reprising the same character in the short lived TV series _"Eischied" (1979)_ (qv). Since then he has proved he is also quite adept at taking on comedy roles, as well as picking up plenty of work playing lawmen, military men, politicians etc. Keep your eye open for him as a nosy police chief in _Fletch (1985)_ (qv), a meglomanical general in _The Living Daylights (1987)_ (qv), as a redneck father in _Mars Attacks! (1996)_ (qv), and as intelligence operative Jack Wade in the 007 films _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv) and _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv).</biographie>

            <biographie>Sean Bean, England's most versatile actor, holds a stellar career spanning every medium for approximately 20 years, in theater, radio, television and movies. This soulful, green-eyed blonde's roles are so varied that his magnetic persona convincing plays angst-ridden villians, as in "Clarissa," passionate lovers like Mellors in "Lady Chatterley's Lover," rough-and-ready soldiers such as Richard Sharpe, heartwrenching warriors as the emotionally torn Boromir in "The Lord of the Rings," and noble Greeks, like Odysseus in "Troy," where his very presence in the film adds grace and validity to the rest of the movie.  Recently, he did a turn in Shakespeare's "Macbeth," where as the principal lead, he so transfixed the audience that the show was extended in London and critically acclaimed.  Bean, however, remains himself, a man's man, and in the glizty world of movies this is a rare thing indeed. Bean currently resides in London where he enjoys raising his beautiful daughters, his beloved football, and the occasional pint. In his home country of England, he was recently voted the second sexiest man in the UK, and seemed to enjoy this notoriety, stating, "I don't have any problems with women seeing me as their ideal bit of 'rough'. Why would I?" Well, good to know, because his legions of fans do not have a problem with it either.</biographie>

            <biographie>Alan Cumming was born on January 27, 1965, in Aberfeldy, Scotland. His family lived nearby in Dunkeld, where his father, Alex, was a forester for Atholl Estate. The family (Alex, mother Mary, big brother Tom and Alan) moved to Fassfern near Fort William soon after, before moving to the east coast of Scotland in 1969 where Alan's dad took up the position of Head Forester of Panmure Estate, and it was here Alan grew up. He went to Monikie Primary School and Carnoustie High School, where he began appearing in plays, and soon after that began working with with the Carnoustie Theatre Club and Carnoustie Musical Society. In 1981 he left high school with 8 'O' Grades and 4 Highers, but because he was too young to enter any university or drama school he worked for just over a year as a sub-editor at D.C. Thomson Publishers in Dundee. There he worked on the launch of a new magazine, "Tops", and was also the "Young Alan" who answered readers' letters. In September 1982 he began a three-year course at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow. He graduated in 1985 with a B.A. (Dramatic Studies) and awards for verse speaking and direction. He also had formed a cabaret double act with fellow student 'Forbes Masson' (qv) called Victor and Barry, which went on to become hugely successful with tours (including two Perrier Pick of the Fringe seasons in London and a month-long engagement at the Sydney Opera House as part of an Australian tour), records ("Hear Victor and Barry and Faint", "Are We Too Loud?") and many TV appearances throughout the UK. Before graduating Alan made his professional theater and film debuts in "Macbeth" at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow and in 'Gillies MacKinnon' (qv)'s "Passing Glory". After graduating Alan worked extensively in Scottish theater and television, including a stint on the soap opera _"Take the High Road" (1980)_ (qv) before moving to London when "Conquest of the South Pole", a play by German playwright 'Manfred Karge' (qv), transferred from the Traverse Theatre in, Edinburgh to the the Royal Court in London, earning him his first Olivier award nomination for Most Promising Newcomer of 1988.  Alan performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company and then the Royal National Theatre, where he starred in "Accidental Death of an Anarchist", which he also adapted with director 'Tim Supple' (qv). The production was nominated for Best revival at the 1991 Olivier awards and Alan won for Comedy Performance of the Year. Then his film career began with 'Ian Sellar (I)' (qv)'s _Prague (1992)_ (qv), in which he starred with 'Sandrine Bonnaire' (qv) and 'Bruno Ganz' (qv). The film premiered at the 1992 Cannes film festival and went on to win him Best Actor award at the Atlantic Film Festival and a Scottish BAFTA Best Actor nomination. In the same year he made two films for the BBC - _"Screen Two" (1985) {The Last Romantics (#8.11)}_ (qv) and _Bernard and the Genie (1991) (TV)_ (qv), the latter winning him the Top Television Newcomer award at 1992 British Comedy Awards. In the 1992 Olivier awards he was also nominated for Comedy Performance of the Year for "La Bete". In 1993 he played Hamlet for the English Touring Theare to great critical acclaim ("An actor knocking on the door of greatness" - Daily Mail; ranked first and second--with his performance in "Cabaret"--in the Daily Telegraph's performances of the year) and then immediately went on to play the Emcee in 'Sam Mendes (I)' (qv)' revival of "Cabaret" at the same venue (London's Donmar Warehouse). He received a 1994 Olivier award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical for "Cabaret", and for Hamlet he received the 1994 TMA Best Actor award and a Shakespeare Globe award nomination.  In 1994 he made his first Hollywood film, _Circle of Friends (1995)_ (qv), and his performance as the oleaginous Sean Walsh along with those in two films released in quick succession (_Emma (1996)_ (qv) and _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv)) brought him to the attention of American producers, and he appeared in several Hollywood films, such as _Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997)_ (qv) and _Buddy (1997)_ (qv). He returned to the UK in 1997 to work with 'Stanley Kubrick' (qv) and the 'Spice Girls' (qv) before returning stateside in 1998 to reprise his role in "Cabaret" on Broadway. The show and his portrayal were a sensation, and he received the Tony, Drama Desk, Outer Critics' Circle, Theatre World, FANY, New York Press and New York Public Advocate's awards for his performance. Since then he has alternated between theater and films, and also between smaller independent films and more mainstream fare. His theater work includes 2001's "Design for Living" on Broadway and the hugely successful off-Broadway "Elle" by 'Jean Genet' (qv), which he adapted and played the lead in 2002. Films have included 'Julie Taymor' (qv)'s _Titus (1999)_ (qv), _Urbania (2000)_ (qv), the "Spy Kids" trilogy, _Josie and the Pussycats (2001)_ (qv), _X2 (2003)_ (qv), _Nicholas Nickleby (2002)_ (qv), _Son of the Mask (2005)_ (qv) and the Showtime movie musical _Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical (2005) (TV)_ (qv). He wrote, directed, produced and acted in _The Anniversary Party (2001)_ (qv) with 'Jennifer Jason Leigh' (qv), which premiered at the Cannes Film festival in 2002 and went on to win a National Board of Review award and two Independent Spirit award nominations. More recently he has produced the documentary Show People (2004) and the films _Sweet Land (2005)_ (qv) and _Full Grown Men (2006)_ (qv) (and appears in both) and acted in _Gray Matters (2006/I)_ (qv) opposite 'Heather Graham (I)' (qv) and _Bam Bam and Celeste (2005)_ (qv) opposite 'Margaret Cho' (qv). in 2006 he will return to Broadway as Macheath in "The Threepenny Opera". He has also found the time to write a novel, "Tommy's Tale", in 2002 and a fragrance, "Cumming" in 2005.</biographie>
